                Today, data is everywhere. Current technology, including AI, is already capable of doing great things
                by leveraging data, but the fundamental problem remains:

                <v-banner class="ma-7" color="green" dark elevation="3"><i>How to efficiently access the data and actually do research with it?</i></v-banner>
                <p>

                    On the other hand, hospitals and CDCs have complex information systems that must comply with
                    legislation such as GDPR.
                    Handling personal data comes with high responsibility, thus care must be taken of cybersecurity,
                    identity management, persistent and immutable storage, auditing, privacy and much more.

        Cybersecurity, identity management, persistent and immutable storage, auditing,
        privacy and much more has to be taken into account.

        All these requirements are met by using specifically designed software solutions,
        which are often maintained by independent software vendors.
        That kind of data access is usually not enough to do research.

        Enter the medical data exploitation platform.

        The platform enables faster and more efficient research by providing access to various relevant medical and
        business-focused data sources. Clean and anonymised data are readily available for use by researchers and
        business analysts.

        Currently, the platform is in prototype phase.
        It allows access to publicly available literature related to novel corona virus. Our search engine goes beyond
        simple keyword search and uses cutting edge AI approaches to automatically annotate whole scientific documents.
        We regularly update the database which currently contains more than 30.000 documents.

        Our platform also offers a unique view of novel corona virus incidence, coupled with side-by-side information
        about the stock exchange sentiment, medical protocols, legislation changes.

        To showcase the power of our platform, we have prepared four case studies. They encompass visualization and
        topic detection in existing literature, a cross-hospital predictive novel corona virus modeling scenario, and
        drug candidate detection.
