      "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infects host cells with its surface glycosylated spike-protein (S-protein). Here we expressed the SARS-CoV S-protein to investigate its interactions with innate immune mechanisms in the lung. The purified S-protein was detected as a 210 kDa glycosylated protein. It was not secreted in the presence of tunicamycin and was detected as a 130 kDa protein in the cell lysate. The purified S-protein bound to Vero but not 293T cells and was itself recognized by lung surfactant protein D (SP-D), a collectin found in the lung alveoli. The binding required Ca 2+ and was inhibited by maltose. The serum collectin, mannan-binding lectin (MBL), exhibited no detectable binding to the purified S-protein. S-protein binds and activates macrophages but not dendritic cells (DCs). It suggests that SARS-CoV interacts with innate immune mechanisms in the lung through its Sprotein and regulates pulmonary inflammation.\n",

In both young and aged mice, an intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific IgG in serum, comparable to those elicited by an intramuscular Alum-adsorbed S-protein vaccine. Serum antibodies were shown to be virus neutralizing. Intranasal immunization of young mice with the Protollin-formulated vaccine elicited significant levels of antigen-specific lung IgA in contrast to mice immunized with the intramuscular vaccine in which no antigen-specific lung IgA was detected. Following live virus challenge of aged mice, no virus was detected in the lungs of intranasally immunized mice, in contrast to intramuscularly immunized mice whose lung virus titers were comparable to those observed in control mice.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "The etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV. Similar to other coronaviruses, spike (S)-glycoprotein of the virus interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells. Accordingly, S-protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. To begin to understand its biochemical and immunological properties, we expressed both full-length and ectodomain of the protein in various primate cells. Our results show that the protein has an electrophoretic mobility of about 160 -170 kDa. The protein is glycosylated with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, which account for approximately 30 kDa of the apparent protein mass. The detection of S-protein by immunoassays was difficult using human convalescent sera, suggesting that the protein may not elicit strong humoral immune response in virus-infected patients. We were able to pseudotype murine leukemia virus particles with S-protein and produce SARS pseudoviruses. Pseudoviruses infected Vero E6 cells in a pH-independent manner and the infection could be specifically inhibited by convalescent sera. Consistent with low levels of antibodies against S-protein, neutralizing activity was weak with 50% neutralization titers ranging between 1:15 to 1:25. To facilitate quantifying pseudovirus-infected cells, which are stained blue with X-Gal, we devised an automated procedure using an ELISPOT analyzer. The high-throughput capacity of this procedure and the safety of using SARS pseudoviruses should make possible large-scale analyses of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV. D\n",

      "The coronavirus S-protein mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. In HCoV-229E, its receptor binding domain (RBD) shows extensive sequence variation but how S-protein function is maintained is not understood. Reported are the X-ray crystal structures of Class III-V RBDs in complex with human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), as well as the electron cryomicroscopy structure of the 229E S-protein. The structures show that common core interactions define the specificity for hAPN and that the peripheral RBD sequence variation is accommodated by loop plasticity. The results provide insight into immune evasion and the crossspecies transmission of 229E and related coronaviruses. We also find that the 229E S-protein can expose a portion of its helical core to solvent. This is undoubtedly facilitated by hydrophilic subunit interfaces that we show are conserved among coronaviruses. These interfaces likely play a role in the S-protein conformational changes associated with membrane fusion.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein is known to mediate receptor interaction and immune recognition and thus it is considered as a major target for vaccine design. The spike protein plays an important role in virus entry, virus receptor interactions, and virus tropism. Sensitive diagnosis of SARS is essential for the control of the disease in humans. Recombinant SARS-CoV S1 antigen was produced and purified for the development of monoclonal and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies. The hybridomas secreting anti-S1 antibodies, F26G18 and P136.8D12, were fused respectively with the YP4 hybridoma to generate quadromas. The sandwich ELISA was formed by using F26G18 as a coating antibody and biotinylated F26G18 as a detection antibody with a detection limit of 0.037 g/ml (p < 0.02). The same detection limit was found with P136.8D12 as a coating antibody and biotinylated F26G18 as a detection antibody. The sensitivity was improved (detection limit of 0.019 g/ml), however, when using bi-specific monoclonal antibody (F157) as the detection antibody. In conclusion, the method described in this study allows sensitive detection of a recombinant SARS spike protein by sandwich ELISA with bi-specific monoclonal antibody and could be used for the diagnosis of patients suspected with SARS.\n",

      "The outbreaks of 2002/2003 SARS, 2012/2015 MERS and 2019/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV.

      "abstract:\n",
      "Following infection of haplotype defined NIH-miniswine with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), isolated mesenteric lymph node CD4 + T-cells mounted a specific proliferative response against infectious or inactivated purified virus in secondary in vitro stimulation. A specific, dose-dependent response to the three major recombinant viral proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), purified by affinity chromatography, was characterized. Induction of in vitro antibody synthesis was analyzed. The purified recombinant viral proteins induced the in vitro synthesis of neutralizing TGEV-specific antibodies when porcine TGEV-immune cells were stimulated with each of the combinations made with two of the major structural proteins: S + N, S + M, and to a minor extent with M + N, but not by the individual proteins. S-protein was dissociated from purified virus using NP-40 detergent and then micellar S-protein oligomers (S-rosettes) were formed by removing the detergent. These occurred preferentially by the association of more than 10 S-protein trimmers. These S-rosettes in collaboration with either N or M-proteins elicited TGEV-specific antibodies with titers up to 84 and 60%, respectively, of those induced by the whole virus. N-protein could be partially substituted by a 15-mer peptide that represents a T helper epitope previously identified :in N-protein (Ant6n et al. (1995)). These results indicate that the induction of high levels of TGEV-specific antibodies requires stimulation by at least two viral proteins, and that optimum responses are induced by a combination of S-rosettes and the nucleoprotein.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "The recent global outbreak of viral pneumonia designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has threatened global public health and urged to investigate its source. Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTG13 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTG13 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability. 2019).

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from 2 China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, 3 called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin-4 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe 5 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 6 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein 7 from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. 8 However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, 9 control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed 10 between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association 11 can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a 12 multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new 13 virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data 14 obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between 15 virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in 16 host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that 17 the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, 18 while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our 19 computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible 20 explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 author/funder.

      "abstract:\n",
      "Vaccine-induced antibodies can prevent or, in the case of feline infectious peritonitis virus, aggravate infections by coronaviruses. We investigated whether a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was able to elicit a neutralizing and protective immune response in animals and analyzed the capacity of anti-S antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus entry in vitro and enhancement of replication in vivo. SARS-CoV-specific serum and mucosal immunoglobulins were readily detected in immunized animals. Serum IgG blocked binding of the S-protein to the ACE2 receptor and neutralized SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Entry into human B cell lines occurred in a Fc␥RII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion indicating that ADE of virus entry is a novel cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV. Vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis and viral load was undetectable or greatly reduced in lungs following challenge with SARS-CoV. Altogether our results indicate that a recombinant trimeric S protein was able to elicit an efficacious protective immune response in vivo and warrant concern in the safety evaluation of a human vaccine against SARS-CoV.\n",

      "RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, a buffer against environmental change. Nevertheless, the means by which random mutation improves viral fitness is not well characterized. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN). Three extended loops are solely responsible for receptor binding and the evolution of HCoV-229E and its close relatives is accompanied by changing loop-receptor interactions. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the natural HCoV-229E receptor-binding loop variation observed defines six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years. These RBD classes differ in their affinity for APN and their ability to bind an HCoV-229E neutralizing antibody. Together, our results provide a model for alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution based on the use of extended loops for receptor binding.\n",

We probed these membranes with four pairs of acute and convalescent sera from recovered SARS cases. We correlated positively reacting peptides with the in vitro SARS-CoV neutralizing activity of the samples. We found that convalescent sera with high neutralizing activity recognized exclusively only a limited number of peptides on the membranes. This suggests that antibodies against the epitopes represented by these peptides could be responsible for much of the SARS-CoV neutralizing activity. The findings have implications for monitoring humoral responses to SARS-CoV as well as for developing a successful SARS vaccine.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in more than 200,000 infections and nearly 9,000 deaths globally so far. This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.\n",

      "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an infectious virus that was first reported in 2012. The MERS-CoV genome encodes four major structural proteins, among which the spike (S) protein has a key role in viral infection and pathogenesis. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain and is an important target for development of MERS vaccines and therapeutics. In this review, we describe the relevant features of the MERS-CoV S-protein RBD, summarize recent advances in the development of MERS-CoV RBD-based vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, and illustrate potential challenges and strategies to further improve their efficacy.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) vary widely in virulence causing a spectrum of clinical manifestations reaching from subclinical course to fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Independent of virulence variations they are separated into two different types, type I, the original FCoV, and type II, which is closely related to canine coronavirus (CCV). The prevalence of FCoV types in Austrian cat populations without FIP has been surveyed recently indicating that type I infections predominate. The distribution of FCoV types in cats, which had succumbed to FIP, however, was fairly unknown. PCR assays have been developed amplifying parts of the spike protein gene. Type-specific primer pairs were designed, generating PCR products of different sizes. A total of 94 organ pools of cats with histopathologically verified FIP was tested. A clear differentiation was achieved in 74 cats, 86% of them were type I positive, 7% type II positive, and 7% were positive for both types. These findings demonstrate that in FIP cases FCoV type I predominates, too, nonetheless, in 14% of the cases FCoV type II was detected, suggesting its causative involvement in cases of FIP.\n",

      "An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.\n",

Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC).

      "abstract:\n",
      "The immunogenicity and efficacy of b-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated whole virion SARS-CoV (WI-SARS) vaccine was evaluated in BALB/c mice and golden Syrian hamsters. The vaccine preparation was tested with or without adjuvants. Adjuvant Systems AS01 B and AS03 A were selected and tested for their capacity to elicit high humoral and cellular immune responses to WI-SARS vaccine. We evaluated the effect of vaccine dose and each adjuvant on immunogenicity and efficacy in mice, and the effect of vaccine dose with or without the AS01 B adjuvant on the immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters. Efficacy was evaluated by challenge with wild-type virus at early and late time points (4 and 18 wk post-vaccination). A single dose of vaccine with or without adjuvant was poorly immunogenic in mice; a second dose resulted in a significant boost in antibody levels, even in the absence of adjuvant. The use of adjuvants resulted in higher antibody titers, with the AS01 B -adjuvanted vaccine being slightly more immunogenic than the AS03 A -adjuvanted vaccine. Two doses of WI-SARS with and without Adjuvant Systems were highly efficacious in mice. In hamsters, two doses of WI-SARS with and without AS01 B were immunogenic, and two doses of 2 mg of WI-SARS with and without the adjuvant provided complete protection from early challenge. Although antibody titers had declined in all groups of vaccinated hamsters 18 wk after the second dose, the vaccinated hamsters were still partially protected from wild-type virus challenge. Vaccine with adjuvant provided better protection than non-adjuvanted WI-SARS vaccine at this later time point. Enhanced disease was not observed in the lungs or liver of hamsters following SARS-CoV challenge, regardless of the level of serum neutralizing antibodies.\n",

      "The porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) devastates the health of piglets but may not infect piglets whose CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene is mutated (knockouts, KO) by using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs. Four live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable Nglycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps.

At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals either deceased or euthanized were necropsied and intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp.

These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) is a membrane-bound, zinc dependent dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to the potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II by removing the two C-terminal amino acids. ACE is well known to be a key part of the rennin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure. The inhibitors of ACE have the potency of treating hypertension. This article reviews the structure-function relationship of ACE as well as its gene polymorphism and inhibitor development. In particular, it has been found that the catalytic mechanisms of the two active sites of somatic ACE in the cleavage of angiotensin I and bradykin are different. Therefore, by specifically targeting the individual active sites of somatic ACE, it will likely offer a new way to develop novel ACE inhibitors with fewer side effects.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Kinins are a family of vasoactive peptides implicated in cardiovascular regulation, inflammation, and nociception. Most of their effects are mediated by the activation of two G protein-coupled receptors, B1 and B2. The B2 receptor binds bradykinin with high affinity in rodents. In humans, the preferred agonist is kallidin or lys-bradykinin. The B1 receptor favors carboxy-metabolites, des-Arg 9 -bradykinin in rodents and des-Arg 10 -kallidin in humans. B2 receptors are constitutive entities while B1 receptors are inducible molecules that may be upregulated under special circumstances [1]. B2 receptors are putative \"good guys\" that modulate blood coagulation by exerting antithrombotic and profibrinolytic actions. They signal the release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, thereby inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell growth and neointimal formation, actions which could slow down the development of atherosclerosis and diabetes-mediated target organ damage. B1 receptors are induced by proinflammatory elements, including endotoxin, lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, or B1 receptor agonists. Innate immunity and pain are obviously important defense mechanisms. However, the inducible B1 receptor has become a desirable drug target when these responses should be held in check. The upregulation of the B1 receptor is a rather novel feature of this inflammatory pathway. The B1 receptor gene promoter is outfitted with a nuclear factor-kappaB binding site that plays a regulatory role, particularly when the receptor is upregulated in response to interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

      "abstract:\n",
      "Drugs that inhibit the production of angiotensin II (AngII) or its access to the type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT 1 R) are prescribed to alleviate high blood pressure and its cardiovascular complications. Accordingly, much research has focused on the molecular pharmacology of AT 1 R activation and signaling. An emerging theme is that the AT 1 R generates G protein dependent as well as independent signals and that these transduction systems separately contribute to AT 1 R biology in health and disease. Regulatory molecules termed arrestins are central to this process as is the capacity of AT 1 R to crosstalk with other receptor systems, such as the widely studied transactivation of growth factor receptors. AT 1 R function can also be modulated by polymorphisms in the AGTR gene, which may significantly alter receptor expression and function; a capacity of the receptor to dimerize/oligomerize with altered pharmacology; and by the cellular environment in which the receptor resides. Together, these aspects of the AT 1 R \"flavour\" the response to angiotensin; they may also contribute to disease, determine the efficacy of current drugs and offer a unique opportunity to develop new therapeutics that antagonize only selective facets of AT 1 R function.\n",

Clarithromycin (CAM), which is an antimicrobial agent and is also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). CAM also suppressed RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and adhesion of fluorescein-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was thought to be mediated by the host cell's PAF receptor. CAM, which exhibits antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found in this study to suppress the RSV-induced adhesion of respiratory disease-causing bacteria, S. pneumoniae, to host cells. Thus, CAM might suppress immunological disorders and prevent secondary bacterial infections during RSV infection.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Recent studies have established a new regulatory axis in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In this axis, angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) is finally produced from Ang I or Ang II by the catalytic activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Ang-(1-7) shows actions different from those of AT 1 receptor stimulation, such as vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti-proliferation and an increase in the bradykinin-NO (nitric oxide) system. As the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 is approximately 400-fold higher with Ang II as a substrate than with Ang I, this axis is possibly acting as a counter-regulatory system against the ACE/Ang II/AT 1 receptor axis. The signaling pathway of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis has not yet been totally and clearly understood. However, a recent report suggests that the Mas oncogene acts as a receptor for Ang-(1-7). Intracellular signaling through Mas is not clear yet. Several factors such as Akt phosphorylation, protein kinase C activation and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibition seem to be involved in this signaling pathway. Further investigations are needed to clarify the regulation and mechanism of action of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7). However, this second axis through ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) in RAS can be an important target for the therapy of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.\n",

It has been shown that S1P 1 receptor agonists such as fingolimod can be suitable candidates for treatment of autoimmune diseases. The current study aimed to generate GRIND-based 3D-QSAR predictive models for agonistic activities of 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives on S1P 1 to be used in virtual screening of chemical libraries. The developed model for the S1P 1 receptor agonists showed appropriate power of predictivity in internal (r 2 acc 0.93 and SDEC 0.18) and external (r 2 0.75 and MAE (95% data), 0.28) validations. The generated model revealed the importance of variables DRY-N1 and DRY-O in the potency and selectivity of these compounds towards S1P 1 receptor. To propose potential chemical entities with S1P 1 agonistic activity, PubChem chemicals database was searched and the selected compounds were virtually tested for S1P 1 receptor agonistic activity using the generated models, which resulted in four potential compounds with high potency and selectivity towards S1P 1 receptor. Moreover, the affinities of the identified compounds towards S1P 1 receptor were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicated that the binding energies of the compounds were in the range of À39.31 to À46.18 and À3.20 to À9.75 kcal mol À1 , calculated by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms, respectively. The findings in the current work may be useful for the identification of potent and selective S1P 1 receptor agonists with potential use in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "Many human viral diseases are a consequence of a zoonotic event. Some of the diseases caused by these zoonotic events have affected millions of people around the world, some of which have resulted in high rates of morbidity/mortality in humans. Changes in the viral proteins that function as ligands of the host receptor may promote the spillover between species. The most recent of these zoonotic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the Covid-19 epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to determine the mutation(s) in the sequence of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that might be favoring human to human transmission. An in silico approach was performed, and changes were detected in the S1 subunit of the receptor-binding domain of spike. The observed changes have significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy, compared to the one of the Bat-CoV to this receptor. The data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the one of Bat-CoV spike and ACE2. This could be the cause of the rapid viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.\n",

      "Significance: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the normal control of cardiovascular and renal function in the healthy state and is a contributing factor in the development and progression of various types of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure. Recent Advances: Evidence suggests that a balance between activation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis and the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis is important for the function of the heart, kidney, and autonomic nervous system control of the circulation in the normal healthy state. An imbalance in these opposing pathways toward the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis is associated with CVD. The key component of this imbalance with respect to neural control of the circulation is the negative interaction between oxidative and NO mechanisms, which leads to enhanced sympathetic tone and activation in disease conditions such as hypertension and heart failure. Critical Issues: The key mechanisms that disrupt normal regulation of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) signaling and promote pathogenesis of CVD at all organ levels remain poorly understood. The reciprocal relation between ACE and ACE2 expression and function suggests they are controlled interdependently at pre-and post-translational levels. Insights from neural studies suggest that an interaction between oxidative and nitrosative pathways may be key.

      "As a critical adaptive mechanism, amino acid replacements on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein could alter the receptor-binding specificity of this envelope glycoprotein and in turn lead to the emergence or reemergence of this viral zoonosis. Based on the X-ray structures of SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with its functional receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2), we perform computational simulations of interactions between three representative RBD mutants and four host species-specific receptors. The comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidences validate our structural bioinformatics approaches. And the predictions further indicate that some viral prototypes might utilize the rat ACE2 while rats might serve as a vector or reservoir of SARS-CoV.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Anibamine, a novel pyridine quaternary alkaloid recently isolated from Aniba sp., has been found to effectively bind to the chemokine receptor CCR5 with an IC 50 at 1 μM in competition with 125 I-gp120, an HIV viral envelope protein binding to CCR5 with high affinity. Since CCR5, a G-proteincoupled receptor, is an essential co-receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) entry to host cells, a CCR5 antagonist that inhibits the cellular entry of HIV-1 provides a new therapy choice for the treatment of HIV. Anibamine provides a novel structural skeleton that is remarkably different from all lead compounds previously identified as CCR5 antagonists. Here, we report comparative docking studies of anibamine with several other known CCR5 antagonists in two CCR5 homology models built based on the crystal structures of bovine rhodopsin and human β 2 -adrenergic receptor. The binding pocket of anibamine has some common features shared with other high affinity CCR5 antagonists, suggesting that they may bind in similar binding sites and/or modes. At the same time, several unique binding features of anibamine were identified and it will likely prove beneficial in future molecular design of novel CCR5 antagonists based on the anibamine scaffold.\n",

      "The COVID-19 disease has plagued over 110 countries and has resulted in over 4,000 deaths within 10 weeks. We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Synthetic analogues of the bradykinin potentiating nonapeptide BPP 9␣ indicate significantly different structural requirements for potentiation of the bradykinin (BK)-induced smooth muscle contraction (GPI) and the inhibition of isolated somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). The results disprove the ACE inhibition as the only single mechanism and also the direct interaction of potentiating peptides with the bradykinin receptors in transfected COS-7 cells as molecular mechanism of potentiation. Our results indicate a stimulation of inositol phosphates (IP n ) formation independently from the B 2 receptor. Furthermore, the results with La 3+ support the role of extracellular Ca 2+ and its influx through corresponding channels. The missing effect of calyculin on the GPI disproves the role of phosphatases in the potentiating action. These experimental studies should not only contribute to a better understanding of the potentiating mechanisms but also incorporate a shift in the research towards the immune system, in particular towards the immunocompetent polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The chemotaxis of these cells can be potentiated most likely by exclusive inhibition of the enzymatic degradation of bradykinin. Thus the obtained results give evidence that the potentiation of the bradykinin action can occur by different mechanisms, depending on the system and on the applied potentiating factor.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Murine carcinoembryonic antigens serve as receptors for the binding and entry of the enveloped coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) into cells. Numerous receptor isoforms are now known, and each has extensive differences in its amino terminal immunoglobulin-like domain (NTD) to which MHV binds via its protruding spike proteins. Some of these receptor alterations may affect the ability to bind viral spikes. To identify individual residues controlling virus binding differences, we have used plasmid and vaccinia virus vectors to express two forms of MHV receptor differing only in their NTD. The two receptors, designated biliary glycoproteins (Bgp) 1 a and 1 b NTD , varied by 29 residues in the 107 amino acid NTD. When expressed from cDNAs in receptor-negative HeLa cells, these two Bgp molecules were displayed on cell surfaces to equivalent levels, as both were equally modified by a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. Infectious center assays revealed that the 1 a isoform was 10 to 100 times more effective than 1 b NTD in its ability to confer sensitivity to MHV (strain A59) infection. Bgp1 a was also more effective than Bgp1 b NTD in comparative virus adsorption assays, binding 6 times more MHV (strain A59) and 2.5 times more MHV (strain JHMX). Bgp1 a was similarly more effective in promoting the capacity of viral spikes to mediate intercellular membrane fusion as judged by quantitation of syncytia following cocultivation of spike and receptor-bearing cells. To identify residues influencing these differences, we inserted varying numbers of 1 b residues into the Bgp1 a background via restriction fragment exchange and site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of the resulting chimeric receptors showed that residues 38 to 43 of the NTD were key determinants of the binding and fusion differences between the two receptors. These residues map to an exposed loop (C-C loop) in a structural model of the closely related human carcinoembryonic antigen. ᭧ 1997 Academic Press\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation and infection is dependent on the presence of a gradient of locally produced chemotactic factors. This review is focused on current knowledge about the activation and regulation of chemoattractant receptors. Emphasis is placed on the members of the N-formyl peptide receptor family, namely FPR (N-formyl peptide receptor), FPRL1 (FPR like-1) and FPRL2 (FPR like-2), and the complement fragment C5a receptors (C5aR and C5L2). Upon chemoattractant binding, the receptors transduce an activation signal through a G protein-dependent pathway, leading to biochemical responses that contribute to physiological defense against bacterial infection and tissue damage. C5aR, and the members of the FPR family that were previously thought to be restricted to phagocytes proved to have a much broader spectrum of cell expression. In addition to N-formylated peptides, numerous unrelated ligands were recently found to interact with FPR and FPRL1. Novel agonists include both pathogen-and host-derived components, and synthetic peptides. Antagonistic molecules have been identified that exhibit limited receptor specificity. How distinct ligands can both induce different biological responses and produce different modes of receptor activation and unique sets of cellular responses are discussed. Cell responses to chemoattractants are tightly regulated at the level of the receptors. This review describes in detail the regulation of receptor signalling and the multi-step process of receptor inactivation. New concepts, such as receptor oligomerization and receptor clustering, are considered. Although FPR, FPRL1 and C5aR trigger similar biological functions and undergo a rapid chemoattractant-mediated phosphorylation, they appear to be differentially regulated and experience different intracellular fates.\n",

      "Objectives. The study assessed the existence and significance of associations between the expression of fifteen renin-angiotensin system component genes and lung adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods. NCBI's built-in statistical tool, GEO2R, was used to calculate Student's -tests for the associations found in a DNA expression study of adenocarcinoma and matched healthy lung tissue samples. The raw data was processed with GeneSpring6 and then used to generate figures with and without Sidak's multiple comparison correction. Results. Ten genes were found to be significantly associated with adenocarcinoma. Seven of these associations remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Notably, AGTR2, which encodes the AT 2 angiotensin II receptor subtype, was significantly underexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue ( < 0.01). AGTR1, ACE, ENPEP, MME, and PRCP, which encode the AT 1 angiotensin II receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase N, neprilysin, and prolylcarboxypeptidase, respectively, were also underexpressed. AGT, which encodes angiotensinogen, the angiotensin peptide precursor, was overexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue. Conclusion. The results suggest an association between the expression of the genes for renin-angiotensin system-related proteins and adenocarcinoma. While further research is necessary to conclusively demonstrate a link between the renin-angiotensin system and lung cancers, the results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the pathology of adenocarcinoma.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "The initial step of retrovirus entry-the interaction between the virus envelope glycoprotein trimer and a cellular receptor-is complex, involving multiple, noncontiguous determinants in both proteins that specify receptor choice, binding affinity and the ability to trigger conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins. Despite the complexity of this interaction, retroviruses have the ability to evolve the structure of their envelope glycoproteins to use a different cellular protein as receptors. The highly homologous subgroup A to E Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) glycoproteins belong to the group of class 1 viral fusion proteins with a two-step triggering mechanism that allows experimental access to intermediate structures during the fusion process. We and others have taken advantage of replication-competent ASLVs and exploited genetic selection strategies to force the ASLVs to naturally evolve and acquire envelope glycoprotein mutations to escape the pressure on virus entry and still yield a functional replicating virus. This approach allows for the simultaneous selection of multiple mutations in multiple functional domains of the envelope glycoprotein that may be required to yield a functional virus. Here, we review the ASLV family and experimental system and the reverse engineering approaches used to understand the evolution of ASLV receptor usage.\n",

      "This study was de,figned mainly to determine the relationships between the expression and distribution of the cellular receptor proteins for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and susceptibility of mouse brain cells during fetal development of Balb/c mice. Immunoblot analysis of fetal extracts demonstrated that the CVB3 receptor proteins were first expressed at day 14 of the fetal stage, and that maximal expression of the cellular receptor occurred at near term or newborn stage. Results also suggested that newborn mouse brain tissue expressed much larger quantities of viral receptor proteins, compared to other tissues. In vitro studies showed that both mouse neurons and astrocytes could be infected by two CVB3 strains, pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain (CVB3N) and myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain (CVB3W). CVB3N, however, replicated and grew to high titer in primary astrocyte cultures and in primary neuron cultures, whereas, primary astrocyte cultures were relatively resistant to CVB3W. Virus binding assays revealed that CVB3N bound faster and in greater amounts to mouse brain cells than CVBW. These two virus strains, however, were found to share the same receptor specificity by virus competition assays. The number of virus binding sites for CVB3 on newborn mouse brain cells was approximately 1.8 x 104 per cell. The data suggested that preferential expression of the cellular receptors on newborn mouse brain cells may be related to their high susceptibilities to CVB3 infection.\n",

      "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance. Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infections. In the lung, ACE2 protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of ARDS. Thus, the RAS appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Indeed, increasing ACE2 activity might be a novel approach for the treatment of acute lung failure in several diseases.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Background: Viral zoonosis, the transmission of a virus from its primary vertebrate reservoir species to humans, requires ubiquitous cellular proteins known as receptor proteins. Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species-in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. Results: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. Conclusions: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.\n",

In this study, we present an optimization strategy to efficiently detect small particles with nanomechanical sensors. Adsorption of particles on the receptor layer of nanomechanical sensors and the resultant signal are analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA). We investigate the effect of structural parameters (e.g., adsorption position and embedded depth of a particle and thickness of the receptor layer) and elastic properties of the receptor layer (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) on the sensitivity. It is found that a membrane-type surface stress sensors (MSS) has the potential for robust detection of small particles.\n",

They are mainly expressed in mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses. N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen-and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription. Despite these new developments, the in vivo functions of FPRs and their ligands in disease states are not yet fully understood.

      "This review analyses recent structural results that provide clues about a possible molecular mechanism for the transmission of a fusogenic signal among the envelope glycoproteins of the herpes simplex virus on receptor binding by glycoprotein gD. This signal triggers the membrane-fusion machinery of the virus-contained in glycoproteins gB, gH and gL-to induce the merging of viral and cellular membranes, and to allow virus entry into target cells. This activating process parallels that of γ-retroviruses, in which receptor binding by the amino-terminal domain of the envelope protein activates the fusogenic potential of the virion in a similar way, despite the different organization of the envelope complexes of these two types of viruses. Therefore, the new structural results on the interaction of gD with its receptors might also provide insights into the mechanism of fusogenic signal transmission in γ-retroviruses. Furthermore, the fusion activation parallels with retroviruses, together with the recently reported structural homology of gB with the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein indicate that the complex entry apparatus of herpesviruses appears to be functionally related to that of simpler enveloped viruses.\n",

      "A newly identified novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused numerous acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan China from December 2019 to Feb 2020. Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets.\n",

      "Tyrosine Phosphorylation of CD13 Regulates Inflammatory Cell- Cell Adhesion and Monocyte Trafficking\n",
      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "CD13 is a large cell surface peptidase expressed on the monocytes and activated endothelial cells important for homing to and resolving the damaged tissue at sites of injury. We have previously shown that crosslinking of human monocytic CD13 with activating antibodies induces strong adhesion to endothelial cells in a tyrosine kinase-and microtubule-dependent manner. In the current study we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations in vitro and in vivo. We found that crosslinking of CD13 on U937 monocytic cells induced phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including Src, FAK and ERK and inhibition of these abrogated CD13dependent adhesion. We found that CD13 itself was phosphorylated in a Src dependent manner, an unexpected finding as its 7 amino acid cytoplasmic tail was assumed to be inert. Furthermore, CD13 was constitutively associated with the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 and CD13 crosslinkinginduced complex formation with the actin-binding protein -actinin, linking membrane-bound CD13 to the cytoskeleton, further supporting CD13 as an inflammatory adhesion molecule. Mechanistically, mutation of the conserved CD13 cytoplasmic tyrosine to phenylalanine abrogated adhesion, Src, FAK and ERK phosphorylation and cytoskeletal alterations upon antibody crosslinking. Finally, CD13 was phosphorylated in isolated murine inflammatory peritoneal exudate cells and adoptive transfer of monocytic cell lines engineered to express the mutant CD13 were severely impaired in their ability to migrate into the inflamed peritoneum, confirming that CD13 phosphorylation is relevant to inflammatory cell trafficking in vivo. Therefore, this study identifies CD13 as a novel, direct activator of intracellular signaling pathways in pathophysiological conditions.\n",

      "Cox, E., Cools, V., Thoonen, H., Hoorens, J. and Houvenaghel, A., 1988. Effect of experimentallyinduced villus atrophy on adhesion of K88ac-positive Escherichia coli in just-weaned piglets. Vet. Microbiol., Three-to four-week-old, just-weaned piglets were infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and the next day with K88ac + enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Histological examination of caudal jejunum and ileum of piglets killed 2-3 days after virus challenge ( 1-2 days after ETEC infection) revealed severe villus atrophy especially in the jejunum compared with controls (P< 0.05). Four-5 days after TGE virus infection villus length increased and after 7 days it was near normal. Villi scraped from jejunal and ileal mucosa of the piglets were incubated in vitro with K88ac + E. coli and the number of bacteria adhering to 250 #m villus brush border was counted. Attachment of bacteria to villi of piglets killed 2-3 days after TGE virus infection was significantly decreased in comparison with adhesion to villi of non-infected piglets or of piglets killed 7 days after the virus infection. Correlation between in vitro adhesion and villus height was 0.6649 (P<0.001). The results suggest that the experimentally-induced villus atrophy was attended with a temporarily diminished susceptibility of villus enterocytes to adhesion of K88ac + E. coli.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Adhesion to the extracellular matrix and endothelial lining of blood vessels is critical for tumor cells to grow at original or metastatic sites. Inhibition of tumor cell adhesion can be an antitumor strategy. Guanosine-rich (G-rich) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) can inhibit the adhesion of certain tumor cells. However, no data exist on how inclusion of the CpG motif in the G-rich sequence influences tumor cell adhesion and subsequent tumorigenesis. In this study, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to evaluate how a panel of ODN-containing contiguous guanosines and the CpG motif influenced adhesion of B16 melanoma cells. The results showed that a self-designed ODN, named BW001, containing the polyG motif and a full phosphorothioate modification backbone could inhibit B16 melanoma cell adhesion on a culture plate or on a plate coated with various substances. In vivo data revealed that B16 melanoma cells co-administered with BW001 and intraperitoneally injected into mice formed fewer tumor colonies in peritoneal cavities. This effect was related to the polyG motif and the full phosphorothioate modification backbone and enhanced by the existence of the CpG motif. Additional in vivo data showed that survival of tumor-bearing mice in the BW001 group was significantly prolonged, subcutaneous melanoma developed much more slowly, and lung dissemination colonies formed much less often than in mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells only. The effect was CpG motif-dependent. These results suggest that BW001 may exert an integrated antitumor effect.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "In the present study, we performed to selectively deplete glycyrrhizin from Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription that consists of 4 Chinese herbs including Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis, and examined its influence on the suppressing activity of Si-Ni-San against contact sensitivity in mice. An immunoaffinity column was made by covalently coupling the polyclonal antibody, obtained by the immunization with glycyrrhizin-BSA conjugate, to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. By using this column, glycyrrhizin in Si-Ni-San was selectively and almost completely depleted from the whole extract, which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both 200 mg/kg of Si-Ni-San and 10 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin, the dose corresponding to its proportion contained in Si-Ni-San, significantly reduced the ear swelling of picryl chloride (PCl)-induced ear contact sensitivity in mice and the inhibition by Si-Ni-San was stronger than that by glycyrrhizin. The adhesion activity to type IV collagen of the isolated spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice was significantly decreased by both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin. However, the glycyrrhizin-depleted sample of Si-Ni-San (Si-Ni-San GLÀ ) only showed a slight inhibition on the cell adhesion. Furthermore, the spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice produced more matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 than naive spleen cells did, and both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin remarkably reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. In contrast, Si-Ni-San GLÀ only showed a slight inhibition. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin may act as one of the active constituents of Si-Ni-San in inhibiting delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction via down-regulating the MMP production and the cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The present study also provides a new approach to recognize and validate an active constituent in traditional prescription through a selective depletion. D\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigenpresenting cells and have come to be appreciated as critical controllers of the immune response, especially T cell responses. Apart from presenting antigens to T cells, DCs carry out many other functions in regulating immunity. DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is a novel receptor that plays an important role in DC migration and adhesion, the inflammatory response, T cell activation, initiating the immune response, and immune escape of pathogens and tumors. DC-SIGN mediates DC binding to ICAM-3 on the T cell surface and ICAM-2 on the endothelial cell (EC) surface, and takes part in the initial interaction between DC and T cells or vascular ECs. The procedure of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a method in which single-stranded oligonucleotides are selected from a wide variety of sequences, based on their interaction with a target molecule. In this study, we selected DNA aptamers against DC-SIGN protein by SE-LEX, and measured their binding affinity for DC-SIGN. Finally, an appropriate aptamer with high affinity for DC-SIGN was obtained, and it blocked DC adhesion to ECs as effectively as anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody.\n",

Therefore, a simple, rapid, and safe method to investigate a therapeutic approach against these pathogens is required. In this study, a simple, quick, and safe cell adhesion inhibition assay was developed to determine the potential cellular binding site on the SARS-CoV spike protein. Various synthetic peptides covering the potential binding site helped to minimize further the binding motif to 10-25 residues. Following analyses, 2 peptides spanning the 436-445 and 437-461 amino acids of the spike protein were identified as peptide inhibitor or peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "The angiotensin converting enzymes (ACEs) are the key catalytic components of the renin-angiotensin system, mediating precise regulation of blood pressure by counterbalancing the effects of each other. Inhibition of ACE has been shown to improve pathology in cardiovascular disease, whilst ACE2 is cardioprotective in the failing heart. However, the mechanisms by which ACE2 mediates its cardioprotective functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 bind integrin subunits, in an RGD-independent manner, and that they can act as cell adhesion substrates. We show that cellular expression of ACE2 enhanced cell adhesion. Furthermore, we present evidence that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is capable of suppressing integrin signalling mediated by FAK. In addition, sACE2 increases the expression of Akt, thereby lowering the proportion of the signalling molecule phosphorylated Akt. These results suggest that ACE2 plays a role in cellcell interactions, possibly acting to fine-tune integrin signalling. Hence the expression and cleavage of ACE2 at the plasma membrane may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the signalling that mediates cell survival and proliferation. As such, ectodomain shedding of ACE2 may play a role in the process of pathological cardiac remodelling.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "The reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins function as virus-encoded cellular fusogens, mediating efficient cell-cell rather than virus-cell membrane fusion. With ectodomains of only ,20-40 residues, it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity, and in their natural biological context of promoting cell-cell fusion, rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins, however, are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cell-cell fusion, but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens, designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. The capacity of surrogate, non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cell-cell fusion activity of the FAST proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine. These results also provide a basis for reconciling the rudimentary structure of the FAST proteins with their capacity to fuse cellular membranes.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Cleft palate results from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors and occurs when the bilateral palatal shelves fail to fuse. The objective of this study was to search for new genes involved in mouse palate formation. Gene expression of murine embryonic palatal tissue was analyzed at various developmental stages before, during, and after palate fusion using GeneChipH microarrays. Ceacam1 was one of the highly up-regulated genes during palate formation, and this was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CEACAM1 was present in prefusion palatal epithelium and was degraded during fusion. To investigate the developmental role of CEACAM1, function-blocking antibody was added to embryonic mouse palate in organ culture. Palatal fusion was inhibited by this function-blocking antibody. To investigate the subsequent developmental role of CEACAM1, we characterized Ceacam1-deficient (Ceacam1 2/ 2 ) mice. Epithelial cells persisted abnormally at the midline of the embryonic palate even on day E16.0, and palatal fusion was delayed in Ceacam1 2/2 mice. TGFb3 expression, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in palatal epithelium were not affected in the palate of Ceacam1 2/2 mice. However, CEACAM1 expression was retained in the remaining MEE of TGFb-deficient mice. These results suggest that CEACAM1 has roles in the initiation of palatal fusion via epithelial cell adhesion.\n",

      "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sometimes causes acute and severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. RSV strongly upregulates proinflammatory cytokines and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Clarithromycin (CAM), which is an antimicrobial agent and is also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). CAM also suppressed RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and adhesion of fluorescein-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was thought to be mediated by the host cell's PAF receptor. CAM, which exhibits antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found in this study to suppress the RSV-induced adhesion of respiratory disease-causing bacteria, S. pneumoniae, to host cells. Thus, CAM might suppress immunological disorders and prevent secondary bacterial infections during RSV infection.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family (CEACAMs) are widely expressed, and, depending on the tissue, capable of regulating diverse functions including tumor promotion, tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and neutrophil activation. Four members of this family, CEACAM1, CEACAM8, CEACAM6, and CEACAM3 (recognized by CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, and CD66d mAbs, respectively), are expressed on human neutrophils. CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, and CD66d antibodies each increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. This increase in neutrophil adhesion caused by CD66 antibodies is blocked by CD18 mAbs and is associated with upregulation of CD11/CD18 on the neutrophil surface. To examine potential interactions of CEACAMs in neutrophil signaling, the effects on neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells of a set of CD66 mAbs was tested following desensitization to stimulation by various combinations of these mAbs. Addition of a CD66 mAb in the absence of calcium results in desensitization of neutrophils to stimulation by that CD66 mAb. The current data show that desensitization of neutrophils to any two CEACAMs results in selective desensitization to those two CEACAMs, while the cells remain responsive to the other two neutrophil CEACAMs. In addition, cells desensitized to CEACAM-3, -6, and -8 were still responsive to stimulation of CEACAM1 by CD66a mAbs. In contrast, desensitization of cells to CEACAM1 and any two of the other CEACAMs left the cells unresponsive to all CD66 mAbs. Cells desensitized to any combination of CEACAMs remained responsive to the unrelated control protein CD63. Thus, while there is significant independence of the four neutrophil CEACAMs in signaling, CEACAM1 appears to play a unique role among the neutrophil CEACAMs. A model in which CEACAMs dimerize to form signaling complexes could accommodate the observations. Similar interactions may occur in other cells expressing CEACAMs.\n",

The probiotic characteristics (including adhesion capability, antimicrobial activities, autoaggregation, and coaggregation abilities), and safety properties (including hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance, absence/presence of virulence factors, and in vivo safety) were evaluated. The results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential, remarkable aggregation capacity, and antibacterial activities. Upon assessment of the safety, these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes. In vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice. This study revealed that these LAB isolates, especially L. salivarius M2-71, possess desirable probiotic properties and have great potentials for the development of feed additives for animals to promote health.\n",

      "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the accumulation of active BCR-ABL protein. Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however, many patients are resistant to this drug. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in imatinib-resistant CML cells under different drug treatments. GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO+AMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.\n",

The results demonstrate that upon binding to membraneanchored ligand, DC-SIGNR undergoes a conformational change similar to that previously observed for DC-SIGN. The results also validate a model for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR derived from crystallographic studies. Force measurements were performed with DC-SIGNR variants that differ in the length of the neck that result from genetic polymorphisms, which encode different numbers of the 23-amino acid repeat sequences that constitute the neck. The findings are consistent with an elongated, relatively rigid structure of the neck repeat observed in crystals. In addition, differences in the lengths of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains with equivalent numbers of neck repeats support a model in which the different dispositions of the carbohydrate-recognition domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR result from variations in the sequences of the necks.\n",

      "The carcinoembryonic antigen family comprises a large number of complex molecules, several of which possess cell adhesion activities. The primordial adhesion molecules of this family are the cell-cell adhesion molecules (C-CAMs), which have been found to be multifunctional, signal-regulatory proteins. C-CAMs inhibit tumor growth, interact with calmodulin, protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, and are subject to specific dimerization reactions. These new insights indicate that C-CAMs are important regulators of cellular functions.\n",

      "Natural Pig Plasma Immunoglobulins Have Anti-Bacterial Effects: Potential for Use as Feed Supplement for Treatment of Intestinal Infections in Pigs\n",
      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "There is an increasing demand for non-antibiotics solutions to control infectious disease in intensive pig production. Here, one such alternative, namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production. A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in >85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4+ challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity. Conclusively, our data support the idea that natural IgG directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of PWD and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Vascular endothelial activation, marked by de novo expression of E-selectin, is an early and essential event in the process of leukocyte extravasation and inflammation. Evidence suggests that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates inflammation in animal models of renal disease, implying that HGF might inhibit specific components of the inflammatory response. This study examined the effect of HGF on endothelial E-selectin expression in acute inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. In vitro, HGF suppressed TNF-a-induced cell surface expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited E-selectin mediated monocytic adhesion to endothelial monolayers. HGF activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt that in turn inhibited its downstream transducer glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3. Blockade of the PI3K-Akt pathway with specific inhibitors abrogated HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppression of E-selectin. In addition, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity by lithium suppressed TNF-a-induced E-selectin expression and monocytic adhesion, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Moreover, ectopic expression of an uninhibitable mutant GSK3b, in which the regulatory serine-9 is replaced by alanine, abolished HGF's suppressive effect on endothelial E-selectin. In vivo, administration of exogenous HGF reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin induced by bolus injection of TNF-a. This was associated with less sequestration of circulating fluorescence-labeled macrophages in the kidney. These findings suggest that HGF ameliorates acute renal inflammation in part by downregulating E-selectin mediated macrophage adhesion to the inflamed endothelium.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Enteric pathogens cause considerable public health concerns worldwide including tropical regions. Here, we review the roles of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of various enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria and protozoa, which infect the epithelial lining of the human and animal intestine. At host cell entry, enteric viruses, including norovirus, recognize mainly histo-blood group antigens. At the initial step of bacterial infections, carbohydrates also function as receptors for attachment. Here, we describe the function of carbohydrates in infection by Salmonella enterica and several bacterial species that produce a variety of fimbrial adhesions. During invasion by enteropathogenic protozoa, apicomplexan parasites utilize sialic acids or sulfated glycans. Carbohydrates serve as receptors for infection by these microbes; however, their usage of carbohydrates varies depending on the microbe. On the surface of the mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, various carbohydrate moieties are present and play a crucial role in infection, representing the site of infection or route of access for most microbes. During the infection and/or invasion process of the microbes, carbohydrates function as receptors for various microbes, but they can also function as a barrier to infection. One approach to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents is to modify the drug structure. Another approach is to modify the mode of inhibition of infection depending on the individual pathogen by using and mimicking the interactions with carbohydrates. In addition, similarities in mode of infection may also be utilized. Our findings will be useful in the development of new drugs for the treatment of enteric pathogens.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "F4 + enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains cause diarrheal disease in neonatal and post-weaned piglets. Several different host receptors for F4 fimbriae have been described, with porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) reported most recently. The FaeG subunit is essential for the binding of the three F4 variants to host cells. Here we show in both yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays that APN binds directly to FaeG, the major subunit of F4 fimbriae, from three serotypes of F4 + ETEC. Modulating APN gene expression in IPEC-J2 cells affected ETEC adherence. Antibodies raised against APN or F4 fimbriae both reduced ETEC adherence. Thus, APN mediates the attachment of F4 + E. coli to intestinal epithelial cells. © 2016 Xia et al.

A more important inactivation of E. coli PHL1273 was obtained on TiO 2 Millennium PC500, in line with its better adherence on this solid. An experimental study was performed using a dialysis membrane to investigate the impact of the contact between the microorganisms and the photocatalyst and to determine the role of H 2 O 2 generated in situ. In air disinfection, a total inactivation of virus A/H5N2, close to avian influenza virus A/H5N2, was obtained in a single pass in the Buxair Ò gas phase dynamic photoreactor using a contaminated air flow rate of 40 m 3 /h.\n",

Effects of blend ratio and of MA content (0.5-15%, w/w) on physical properties of the polymer composite were investigated. The toluene resistance of the polymer blend was improved after adding MA and cellulose. The highest toluene resistance was achieved when using 12% cellulose. The chemical reactions of MA with polymer blend and with composite were confirmed by ATR-FTIR. The hardness of the polymer blend and composite increased as a function of PSF.

We postulate that these two interleukins may participate in the early phase of TBE and NB. The aim of the study was to measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of ICAM-1, IL-21 and IL-23 in patients with TBE and NB before treatment and to assess their usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory process in TBE and NB. Methods: Forty-three patients hospitalized in The were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: TBE, NB and CG. Pre-treatment blood and CSF samples were obtained from all patients. ELISA kits (DRG Instruments, Germany) were used to measure the concentration of IL-21, IL-23 and sICAM-1. Results: Significant differences between TBE/CG and NB/CG concentration of sICAM-1 were found only in the CSF. CSF IL-21 levels in NB were lower than in TBE. In TBE, a strong negative correlation between CSF concentration of IL-21 and IL-23 and monocyte count in CSF was observed. Negative correlation between IL-21 in CSF and neutrophil count was also noted. Serum IL-23 correlated positively with leukocytes and platelet count in serum. In NB, a strong positive correlation between serum IL-21 and platelet count and negative correlation between IL-21 in serum and CSF with pleocytosis was observed. Conclusions: Increased sICAM-1 concentration in TBE and NB may be a proof of brain-blood barrier disturbances in the early phase of these diseases. IL-21 and IL-23 do not appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the early stages of TBE and NB.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Viruses are one of the major causes of various acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape. author/funder.

Thus carbohydrate has been suggested to underly a non-primary function for proteins, such as in relatively non-specific interactions with other carbohydrates or macromolecules, stabilization of protein conformation, or protection from proteolysis. This non-specific concept is consistent with both the general similarity in carbohydrate structure on very diverse glycoproteins and the frequent structural microheterogeneity of carbohydrate chains at given sites. The concept is supported in a general sense by the viability of cells whose glycosylation processes have been globally disrupted by mutation or pharmacological inhibitors.\n",

The aetiopathogenesis is not well known but it is accepted that an undefined infectious trigger in genetically predisposed individuals results in the disease. KD is characterized by an endothelial cell injury, which could be due to abnormal cytokine production and to generation of cytotoxic antibodies against the endothelial cells. Intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG is an effective treatment in preventing the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities in KD. Several mechanisms may explain the anti-inflammatory effects of IVIG in this disease. They include modification of the cytokine balance, and alteration on both the differentiation and the function of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes.\n",

      "CD9 belongs to the tetraspanin superfamily. Depending on the cell type and associated molecules, CD9 has a wide variety of biological activities such as cell adhesion, motility, metastasis, growth, signal transduction, differentiation, and sperm-egg fusion. This review focuses on CD9 expression by hematopoietic cells and its role in modulating cellular processes involved in the regulation of inflammation. CD9 is functionally very important in many diseases and is involved either in the regulation or in the mediation of the disease. The role of CD9 in various diseases, such as viral and bacterial infections, cancer and chronic lung allograft dysfunction, is discussed. This review focuses also on its interest as a biomarker in diseases. Indeed CD9 is primarily known as a specific exosome marker however, its expression is now recognized as an anti-inflammatory marker of monocytes and macrophages. It was also described as a marker of murine IL-10-competent Breg cells and IL-10-secreting CD9 + B cells were associated with better allograft outcome in lung transplant patients, and identified as a new predictive biomarker of long-term survival. In the field of cancer, CD9 was both identified as a favorable prognostic marker or as a predictor of metastatic potential depending on cancer types. Finally, this review discusses strategies to target CD9 as a therapeutic tool. Because CD9 can have opposite effects depending on the situation, the environment and the pathology, modulating CD9 expression or blocking its effects seem to be a new promising therapeutic strategy.\n",

      "The fiber knob of adenovirus (Ad) causes the first step in the interaction of adenovirus with cell membrane receptors. To obtain information on the receptor binding site(s) several synthetic peptides derived from Ad2 and Ad3 fiber head sequences and their antisera were tested for interference with virus attachment to HeLa and FL cells and cell adhesion to viruses. The anti-peptide sera were also evaluated in ELISA and virus neutralisation test. Ad2 (of subgroup C) and Ad3 (of subgroup B) attachment was not significantly inhibited by peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 535 554, 555-573, 562-582 of Ad2 fiber or 210-225, 267-283, 291-306 and 300-319 of Ad3 fiber. However, microplate pre-adsorbed Ad3 fiber residues 210 225 and 267 283 could bind FL and HeLa cells, and 1 mg/ml of Ad3 fiber residues 267-283 inhibited the cell adhesion to Ad3 virus to approximately 90%. This peptide may participate in the receptor binding site of Ad3 fiber. ELISA reactive anti-peptide antibodies against the homologous peptide and virus did not significantly reduce the cell adhesion to the immobilised virus or the virus attachment to cells, but in the neutralisation assay antibodies raised to Ad2 fiber residues 555-573 and 562-582 and Ad3 fiber residues 210-225 caused neutralisation of the homologous virus at serum dilutions of 1:500 and 1:32, respectively. The corresponding peptides and one further peptide of Ad2 fiber and two of Ad3 fiber seem to contain neutralisation epitopes.\n",

      "Mycoplasma suis (M. suis) is an extracellular bacterial organism that attaches to and causes deformity and damage to porcine red blood cells. M. suis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like protein 1 (MSG1), a membraneassociated adhesion protein, plays a major role in M. suis attachment and infection of porcine erythrocytes. In order to identify the epitopes in MSG1 protein of M. suis, recombinant MSG1 (rMSG1) expressed in Escherichia coli Top10 was purified with affinity chromatography and used to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare and screen monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Western blot results showed that 1C10, 2F10, 4G10, and 10E9 can specifically react with recombinant MSG1 and M. suis. Moreover, 23 truncated fragments of MSG1 were amplified and cloned into pET-32a vector and induced by IPTG. Different recombinant truncated proteins were used to identify B cell epitopes in the rMSG1 protein. Epitope mapping revealed that MAb 1C10 recognizes the linear epitope D 291 THGSVF 297 ; MAb 2F10 recognizes the linear epitope L 251 CLKI 255 ; and MAbs 4G10 and 10E9 recognize the linear epitope I 268 KDGENE 274 . The alignment of MSG1 epitope sequences with that of different M. suis strains accessed on NCBI showed that one epitope is highly conserved in M. suis strains. This research is the first to examine the epitopes in MSG1 of M. suis and demonstrate the variations of epitopes.\n",

Here we expressed the SARS-CoV S-protein to investigate its interactions with innate immune mechanisms in the lung. The purified S-protein was detected as a 210 kDa glycosylated protein. It was not secreted in the presence of tunicamycin and was detected as a 130 kDa protein in the cell lysate. The purified S-protein bound to Vero but not 293T cells and was itself recognized by lung surfactant protein D (SP-D), a collectin found in the lung alveoli. The binding required Ca 2+ and was inhibited by maltose. The serum collectin, mannan-binding lectin (MBL), exhibited no detectable binding to the purified S-protein. S-protein binds and activates macrophages but not dendritic cells (DCs). It suggests that SARS-CoV interacts with innate immune mechanisms in the lung through its Sprotein and regulates pulmonary inflammation.\n",

      "The feasibility of developing a prophylactic vaccine against SARS was assessed by comparing the immune responses elicited by immunizing mice with a recombinant SARS spike glycoprotein (S-protein) formulated with different adjuvants, given by different routes. In both young and aged mice, an intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific IgG in serum, comparable to those elicited by an intramuscular Alum-adsorbed S-protein vaccine. Serum antibodies were shown to be virus neutralizing. Intranasal immunization of young mice with the Protollin-formulated vaccine elicited significant levels of antigen-specific lung IgA in contrast to mice immunized with the intramuscular vaccine in which no antigen-specific lung IgA was detected. Following live virus challenge of aged mice, no virus was detected in the lungs of intranasally immunized mice, in contrast to intramuscularly immunized mice whose lung virus titers were comparable to those observed in control mice.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "The etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV. Similar to other coronaviruses, spike (S)-glycoprotein of the virus interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells. Accordingly, S-protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. To begin to understand its biochemical and immunological properties, we expressed both full-length and ectodomain of the protein in various primate cells. Our results show that the protein has an electrophoretic mobility of about 160 -170 kDa. The protein is glycosylated with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, which account for approximately 30 kDa of the apparent protein mass. The detection of S-protein by immunoassays was difficult using human convalescent sera, suggesting that the protein may not elicit strong humoral immune response in virus-infected patients. We were able to pseudotype murine leukemia virus particles with S-protein and produce SARS pseudoviruses. Pseudoviruses infected Vero E6 cells in a pH-independent manner and the infection could be specifically inhibited by convalescent sera. Consistent with low levels of antibodies against S-protein, neutralizing activity was weak with 50% neutralization titers ranging between 1:15 to 1:25. To facilitate quantifying pseudovirus-infected cells, which are stained blue with X-Gal, we devised an automated procedure using an ELISPOT analyzer. The high-throughput capacity of this procedure and the safety of using SARS pseudoviruses should make possible large-scale analyses of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV. D\n",

      "The coronavirus S-protein mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. In HCoV-229E, its receptor binding domain (RBD) shows extensive sequence variation but how S-protein function is maintained is not understood. Reported are the X-ray crystal structures of Class III-V RBDs in complex with human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), as well as the electron cryomicroscopy structure of the 229E S-protein. The structures show that common core interactions define the specificity for hAPN and that the peripheral RBD sequence variation is accommodated by loop plasticity. The results provide insight into immune evasion and the crossspecies transmission of 229E and related coronaviruses. We also find that the 229E S-protein can expose a portion of its helical core to solvent. This is undoubtedly facilitated by hydrophilic subunit interfaces that we show are conserved among coronaviruses. These interfaces likely play a role in the S-protein conformational changes associated with membrane fusion.\n",

      "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein is known to mediate receptor interaction and immune recognition and thus it is considered as a major target for vaccine design. The spike protein plays an important role in virus entry, virus receptor interactions, and virus tropism. Sensitive diagnosis of SARS is essential for the control of the disease in humans. Recombinant SARS-CoV S1 antigen was produced and purified for the development of monoclonal and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies. The hybridomas secreting anti-S1 antibodies, F26G18 and P136.8D12, were fused respectively with the YP4 hybridoma to generate quadromas. The sandwich ELISA was formed by using F26G18 as a coating antibody and biotinylated F26G18 as a detection antibody with a detection limit of 0.037 g/ml (p < 0.02). The same detection limit was found with P136.8D12 as a coating antibody and biotinylated F26G18 as a detection antibody. The sensitivity was improved (detection limit of 0.019 g/ml), however, when using bi-specific monoclonal antibody (F157) as the detection antibody. In conclusion, the method described in this study allows sensitive detection of a recombinant SARS spike protein by sandwich ELISA with bi-specific monoclonal antibody and could be used for the diagnosis of patients suspected with SARS.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Following infection of haplotype defined NIH-miniswine with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), isolated mesenteric lymph node CD4 + T-cells mounted a specific proliferative response against infectious or inactivated purified virus in secondary in vitro stimulation. A specific, dose-dependent response to the three major recombinant viral proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), purified by affinity chromatography, was characterized. Induction of in vitro antibody synthesis was analyzed. The purified recombinant viral proteins induced the in vitro synthesis of neutralizing TGEV-specific antibodies when porcine TGEV-immune cells were stimulated with each of the combinations made with two of the major structural proteins: S + N, S + M, and to a minor extent with M + N, but not by the individual proteins. S-protein was dissociated from purified virus using NP-40 detergent and then micellar S-protein oligomers (S-rosettes) were formed by removing the detergent. These occurred preferentially by the association of more than 10 S-protein trimmers. These S-rosettes in collaboration with either N or M-proteins elicited TGEV-specific antibodies with titers up to 84 and 60%, respectively, of those induced by the whole virus. N-protein could be partially substituted by a 15-mer peptide that represents a T helper epitope previously identified :in N-protein (Ant6n et al. (1995)). These results indicate that the induction of high levels of TGEV-specific antibodies requires stimulation by at least two viral proteins, and that optimum responses are induced by a combination of S-rosettes and the nucleoprotein.\n",

      "The recent global outbreak of viral pneumonia designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has threatened global public health and urged to investigate its source. Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTG13 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTG13 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability. 2019).

      "RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, a buffer against environmental change. Nevertheless, the means by which random mutation improves viral fitness is not well characterized. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN). Three extended loops are solely responsible for receptor binding and the evolution of HCoV-229E and its close relatives is accompanied by changing loop-receptor interactions. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the natural HCoV-229E receptor-binding loop variation observed defines six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years. These RBD classes differ in their affinity for APN and their ability to bind an HCoV-229E neutralizing antibody. Together, our results provide a model for alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution based on the use of extended loops for receptor binding.\n",

We probed these membranes with four pairs of acute and convalescent sera from recovered SARS cases. We correlated positively reacting peptides with the in vitro SARS-CoV neutralizing activity of the samples. We found that convalescent sera with high neutralizing activity recognized exclusively only a limited number of peptides on the membranes. This suggests that antibodies against the epitopes represented by these peptides could be responsible for much of the SARS-CoV neutralizing activity. The findings have implications for monitoring humoral responses to SARS-CoV as well as for developing a successful SARS vaccine.\n",

Independent of virulence variations they are separated into two different types, type I, the original FCoV, and type II, which is closely related to canine coronavirus (CCV). The prevalence of FCoV types in Austrian cat populations without FIP has been surveyed recently indicating that type I infections predominate. The distribution of FCoV types in cats, which had succumbed to FIP, however, was fairly unknown. PCR assays have been developed amplifying parts of the spike protein gene. Type-specific primer pairs were designed, generating PCR products of different sizes. A total of 94 organ pools of cats with histopathologically verified FIP was tested. A clear differentiation was achieved in 74 cats, 86% of them were type I positive, 7% type II positive, and 7% were positive for both types. These findings demonstrate that in FIP cases FCoV type I predominates, too, nonetheless, in 14% of the cases FCoV type II was detected, suggesting its causative involvement in cases of FIP.\n",

      "The immunogenicity and efficacy of b-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated whole virion SARS-CoV (WI-SARS) vaccine was evaluated in BALB/c mice and golden Syrian hamsters. The vaccine preparation was tested with or without adjuvants. Adjuvant Systems AS01 B and AS03 A were selected and tested for their capacity to elicit high humoral and cellular immune responses to WI-SARS vaccine. We evaluated the effect of vaccine dose and each adjuvant on immunogenicity and efficacy in mice, and the effect of vaccine dose with or without the AS01 B adjuvant on the immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters. Efficacy was evaluated by challenge with wild-type virus at early and late time points (4 and 18 wk post-vaccination). A single dose of vaccine with or without adjuvant was poorly immunogenic in mice; a second dose resulted in a significant boost in antibody levels, even in the absence of adjuvant. The use of adjuvants resulted in higher antibody titers, with the AS01 B -adjuvanted vaccine being slightly more immunogenic than the AS03 A -adjuvanted vaccine. Two doses of WI-SARS with and without Adjuvant Systems were highly efficacious in mice. In hamsters, two doses of WI-SARS with and without AS01 B were immunogenic, and two doses of 2 mg of WI-SARS with and without the adjuvant provided complete protection from early challenge. Although antibody titers had declined in all groups of vaccinated hamsters 18 wk after the second dose, the vaccinated hamsters were still partially protected from wild-type virus challenge. Vaccine with adjuvant provided better protection than non-adjuvanted WI-SARS vaccine at this later time point. Enhanced disease was not observed in the lungs or liver of hamsters following SARS-CoV challenge, regardless of the level of serum neutralizing antibodies.\n",

This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs. Four live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable Nglycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps.

RSV strongly upregulates proinflammatory cytokines and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Clarithromycin (CAM), which is an antimicrobial agent and is also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). CAM also suppressed RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and adhesion of fluorescein-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was thought to be mediated by the host cell's PAF receptor. CAM, which exhibits antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found in this study to suppress the RSV-induced adhesion of respiratory disease-causing bacteria, S. pneumoniae, to host cells.

      "Sphingosine 1-phosphate type 1 (S1P 1 ) receptors are expressed on lymphocytes and regulate immune cells trafficking. Sphingosine 1-phosphate and its analogues cause internalization and degradation of S1P 1 receptors, preventing the auto reactivity of immune cells in the target tissues. It has been shown that S1P 1 receptor agonists such as fingolimod can be suitable candidates for treatment of autoimmune diseases. The current study aimed to generate GRIND-based 3D-QSAR predictive models for agonistic activities of 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives on S1P 1 to be used in virtual screening of chemical libraries. The developed model for the S1P 1 receptor agonists showed appropriate power of predictivity in internal (r 2 acc 0.93 and SDEC 0.18) and external (r 2 0.75 and MAE (95% data), 0.28) validations. The generated model revealed the importance of variables DRY-N1 and DRY-O in the potency and selectivity of these compounds towards S1P 1 receptor. To propose potential chemical entities with S1P 1 agonistic activity, PubChem chemicals database was searched and the selected compounds were virtually tested for S1P 1 receptor agonistic activity using the generated models, which resulted in four potential compounds with high potency and selectivity towards S1P 1 receptor. Moreover, the affinities of the identified compounds towards S1P 1 receptor were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicated that the binding energies of the compounds were in the range of À39.31 to À46.18 and À3.20 to À9.75 kcal mol À1 , calculated by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms, respectively. The findings in the current work may be useful for the identification of potent and selective S1P 1 receptor agonists with potential use in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "Anibamine, a novel pyridine quaternary alkaloid recently isolated from Aniba sp., has been found to effectively bind to the chemokine receptor CCR5 with an IC 50 at 1 μM in competition with 125 I-gp120, an HIV viral envelope protein binding to CCR5 with high affinity. Since CCR5, a G-proteincoupled receptor, is an essential co-receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) entry to host cells, a CCR5 antagonist that inhibits the cellular entry of HIV-1 provides a new therapy choice for the treatment of HIV. Anibamine provides a novel structural skeleton that is remarkably different from all lead compounds previously identified as CCR5 antagonists. Here, we report comparative docking studies of anibamine with several other known CCR5 antagonists in two CCR5 homology models built based on the crystal structures of bovine rhodopsin and human β 2 -adrenergic receptor. The binding pocket of anibamine has some common features shared with other high affinity CCR5 antagonists, suggesting that they may bind in similar binding sites and/or modes. At the same time, several unique binding features of anibamine were identified and it will likely prove beneficial in future molecular design of novel CCR5 antagonists based on the anibamine scaffold.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Murine carcinoembryonic antigens serve as receptors for the binding and entry of the enveloped coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) into cells. Numerous receptor isoforms are now known, and each has extensive differences in its amino terminal immunoglobulin-like domain (NTD) to which MHV binds via its protruding spike proteins. Some of these receptor alterations may affect the ability to bind viral spikes. To identify individual residues controlling virus binding differences, we have used plasmid and vaccinia virus vectors to express two forms of MHV receptor differing only in their NTD. The two receptors, designated biliary glycoproteins (Bgp) 1 a and 1 b NTD , varied by 29 residues in the 107 amino acid NTD. When expressed from cDNAs in receptor-negative HeLa cells, these two Bgp molecules were displayed on cell surfaces to equivalent levels, as both were equally modified by a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. Infectious center assays revealed that the 1 a isoform was 10 to 100 times more effective than 1 b NTD in its ability to confer sensitivity to MHV (strain A59) infection. Bgp1 a was also more effective than Bgp1 b NTD in comparative virus adsorption assays, binding 6 times more MHV (strain A59) and 2.5 times more MHV (strain JHMX). Bgp1 a was similarly more effective in promoting the capacity of viral spikes to mediate intercellular membrane fusion as judged by quantitation of syncytia following cocultivation of spike and receptor-bearing cells. To identify residues influencing these differences, we inserted varying numbers of 1 b residues into the Bgp1 a background via restriction fragment exchange and site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of the resulting chimeric receptors showed that residues 38 to 43 of the NTD were key determinants of the binding and fusion differences between the two receptors. These residues map to an exposed loop (C-C loop) in a structural model of the closely related human carcinoembryonic antigen. ᭧ 1997 Academic Press\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation and infection is dependent on the presence of a gradient of locally produced chemotactic factors. This review is focused on current knowledge about the activation and regulation of chemoattractant receptors. Emphasis is placed on the members of the N-formyl peptide receptor family, namely FPR (N-formyl peptide receptor), FPRL1 (FPR like-1) and FPRL2 (FPR like-2), and the complement fragment C5a receptors (C5aR and C5L2). Upon chemoattractant binding, the receptors transduce an activation signal through a G protein-dependent pathway, leading to biochemical responses that contribute to physiological defense against bacterial infection and tissue damage. C5aR, and the members of the FPR family that were previously thought to be restricted to phagocytes proved to have a much broader spectrum of cell expression. In addition to N-formylated peptides, numerous unrelated ligands were recently found to interact with FPR and FPRL1. Novel agonists include both pathogen-and host-derived components, and synthetic peptides. Antagonistic molecules have been identified that exhibit limited receptor specificity. How distinct ligands can both induce different biological responses and produce different modes of receptor activation and unique sets of cellular responses are discussed. Cell responses to chemoattractants are tightly regulated at the level of the receptors. This review describes in detail the regulation of receptor signalling and the multi-step process of receptor inactivation. New concepts, such as receptor oligomerization and receptor clustering, are considered. Although FPR, FPRL1 and C5aR trigger similar biological functions and undergo a rapid chemoattractant-mediated phosphorylation, they appear to be differentially regulated and experience different intracellular fates.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "The initial step of retrovirus entry-the interaction between the virus envelope glycoprotein trimer and a cellular receptor-is complex, involving multiple, noncontiguous determinants in both proteins that specify receptor choice, binding affinity and the ability to trigger conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins. Despite the complexity of this interaction, retroviruses have the ability to evolve the structure of their envelope glycoproteins to use a different cellular protein as receptors. The highly homologous subgroup A to E Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) glycoproteins belong to the group of class 1 viral fusion proteins with a two-step triggering mechanism that allows experimental access to intermediate structures during the fusion process. We and others have taken advantage of replication-competent ASLVs and exploited genetic selection strategies to force the ASLVs to naturally evolve and acquire envelope glycoprotein mutations to escape the pressure on virus entry and still yield a functional replicating virus. This approach allows for the simultaneous selection of multiple mutations in multiple functional domains of the envelope glycoprotein that may be required to yield a functional virus. Here, we review the ASLV family and experimental system and the reverse engineering approaches used to understand the evolution of ASLV receptor usage.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "This study was de,figned mainly to determine the relationships between the expression and distribution of the cellular receptor proteins for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and susceptibility of mouse brain cells during fetal development of Balb/c mice. Immunoblot analysis of fetal extracts demonstrated that the CVB3 receptor proteins were first expressed at day 14 of the fetal stage, and that maximal expression of the cellular receptor occurred at near term or newborn stage. Results also suggested that newborn mouse brain tissue expressed much larger quantities of viral receptor proteins, compared to other tissues. In vitro studies showed that both mouse neurons and astrocytes could be infected by two CVB3 strains, pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain (CVB3N) and myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain (CVB3W). CVB3N, however, replicated and grew to high titer in primary astrocyte cultures and in primary neuron cultures, whereas, primary astrocyte cultures were relatively resistant to CVB3W. Virus binding assays revealed that CVB3N bound faster and in greater amounts to mouse brain cells than CVBW. These two virus strains, however, were found to share the same receptor specificity by virus competition assays. The number of virus binding sites for CVB3 on newborn mouse brain cells was approximately 1.8 x 104 per cell. The data suggested that preferential expression of the cellular receptors on newborn mouse brain cells may be related to their high susceptibilities to CVB3 infection.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Background: Viral zoonosis, the transmission of a virus from its primary vertebrate reservoir species to humans, requires ubiquitous cellular proteins known as receptor proteins. Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species-in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. Results: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. Conclusions: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.\n",

      "Detection of small particles, including viruses and particulate matter (PM), has been attracting much attention in light of increasing need for environmental monitoring. Owing to their high versatility, a nanomechanical sensor is one of the most promising sensors which can be adapted to various monitoring systems. In this study, we present an optimization strategy to efficiently detect small particles with nanomechanical sensors. Adsorption of particles on the receptor layer of nanomechanical sensors and the resultant signal are analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA). We investigate the effect of structural parameters (e.g., adsorption position and embedded depth of a particle and thickness of the receptor layer) and elastic properties of the receptor layer (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) on the sensitivity. It is found that a membrane-type surface stress sensors (MSS) has the potential for robust detection of small particles.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) belong to the classical G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor family. They are mainly expressed in mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses. N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen-and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription. Despite these new developments, the in vivo functions of FPRs and their ligands in disease states are not yet fully understood.

      "This review analyses recent structural results that provide clues about a possible molecular mechanism for the transmission of a fusogenic signal among the envelope glycoproteins of the herpes simplex virus on receptor binding by glycoprotein gD. This signal triggers the membrane-fusion machinery of the virus-contained in glycoproteins gB, gH and gL-to induce the merging of viral and cellular membranes, and to allow virus entry into target cells. This activating process parallels that of γ-retroviruses, in which receptor binding by the amino-terminal domain of the envelope protein activates the fusogenic potential of the virion in a similar way, despite the different organization of the envelope complexes of these two types of viruses. Therefore, the new structural results on the interaction of gD with its receptors might also provide insights into the mechanism of fusogenic signal transmission in γ-retroviruses. Furthermore, the fusion activation parallels with retroviruses, together with the recently reported structural homology of gB with the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein indicate that the complex entry apparatus of herpesviruses appears to be functionally related to that of simpler enveloped viruses.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "CD13 is a large cell surface peptidase expressed on the monocytes and activated endothelial cells important for homing to and resolving the damaged tissue at sites of injury. We have previously shown that crosslinking of human monocytic CD13 with activating antibodies induces strong adhesion to endothelial cells in a tyrosine kinase-and microtubule-dependent manner. In the current study we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations in vitro and in vivo. We found that crosslinking of CD13 on U937 monocytic cells induced phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including Src, FAK and ERK and inhibition of these abrogated CD13dependent adhesion. We found that CD13 itself was phosphorylated in a Src dependent manner, an unexpected finding as its 7 amino acid cytoplasmic tail was assumed to be inert. Furthermore, CD13 was constitutively associated with the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 and CD13 crosslinkinginduced complex formation with the actin-binding protein -actinin, linking membrane-bound CD13 to the cytoskeleton, further supporting CD13 as an inflammatory adhesion molecule. Mechanistically, mutation of the conserved CD13 cytoplasmic tyrosine to phenylalanine abrogated adhesion, Src, FAK and ERK phosphorylation and cytoskeletal alterations upon antibody crosslinking. Finally, CD13 was phosphorylated in isolated murine inflammatory peritoneal exudate cells and adoptive transfer of monocytic cell lines engineered to express the mutant CD13 were severely impaired in their ability to migrate into the inflamed peritoneum, confirming that CD13 phosphorylation is relevant to inflammatory cell trafficking in vivo. Therefore, this study identifies CD13 as a novel, direct activator of intracellular signaling pathways in pathophysiological conditions.\n",

Vet. Microbiol., Three-to four-week-old, just-weaned piglets were infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and the next day with K88ac + enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Histological examination of caudal jejunum and ileum of piglets killed 2-3 days after virus challenge ( 1-2 days after ETEC infection) revealed severe villus atrophy especially in the jejunum compared with controls (P< 0.05). Four-5 days after TGE virus infection villus length increased and after 7 days it was near normal. Villi scraped from jejunal and ileal mucosa of the piglets were incubated in vitro with K88ac + E. coli and the number of bacteria adhering to 250 #m villus brush border was counted. Attachment of bacteria to villi of piglets killed 2-3 days after TGE virus infection was significantly decreased in comparison with adhesion to villi of non-infected piglets or of piglets killed 7 days after the virus infection. Correlation between in vitro adhesion and villus height was 0.6649 (P<0.001). The results suggest that the experimentally-induced villus atrophy was attended with a temporarily diminished susceptibility of villus enterocytes to adhesion of K88ac + E. coli.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Adhesion to the extracellular matrix and endothelial lining of blood vessels is critical for tumor cells to grow at original or metastatic sites. Inhibition of tumor cell adhesion can be an antitumor strategy. Guanosine-rich (G-rich) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) can inhibit the adhesion of certain tumor cells. However, no data exist on how inclusion of the CpG motif in the G-rich sequence influences tumor cell adhesion and subsequent tumorigenesis. In this study, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to evaluate how a panel of ODN-containing contiguous guanosines and the CpG motif influenced adhesion of B16 melanoma cells. The results showed that a self-designed ODN, named BW001, containing the polyG motif and a full phosphorothioate modification backbone could inhibit B16 melanoma cell adhesion on a culture plate or on a plate coated with various substances. In vivo data revealed that B16 melanoma cells co-administered with BW001 and intraperitoneally injected into mice formed fewer tumor colonies in peritoneal cavities. This effect was related to the polyG motif and the full phosphorothioate modification backbone and enhanced by the existence of the CpG motif. Additional in vivo data showed that survival of tumor-bearing mice in the BW001 group was significantly prolonged, subcutaneous melanoma developed much more slowly, and lung dissemination colonies formed much less often than in mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells only. The effect was CpG motif-dependent. These results suggest that BW001 may exert an integrated antitumor effect.\n",

      "In the present study, we performed to selectively deplete glycyrrhizin from Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription that consists of 4 Chinese herbs including Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis, and examined its influence on the suppressing activity of Si-Ni-San against contact sensitivity in mice. An immunoaffinity column was made by covalently coupling the polyclonal antibody, obtained by the immunization with glycyrrhizin-BSA conjugate, to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. By using this column, glycyrrhizin in Si-Ni-San was selectively and almost completely depleted from the whole extract, which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both 200 mg/kg of Si-Ni-San and 10 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin, the dose corresponding to its proportion contained in Si-Ni-San, significantly reduced the ear swelling of picryl chloride (PCl)-induced ear contact sensitivity in mice and the inhibition by Si-Ni-San was stronger than that by glycyrrhizin. The adhesion activity to type IV collagen of the isolated spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice was significantly decreased by both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin. However, the glycyrrhizin-depleted sample of Si-Ni-San (Si-Ni-San GLÀ ) only showed a slight inhibition on the cell adhesion. Furthermore, the spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice produced more matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 than naive spleen cells did, and both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin remarkably reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. In contrast, Si-Ni-San GLÀ only showed a slight inhibition. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin may act as one of the active constituents of Si-Ni-San in inhibiting delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction via down-regulating the MMP production and the cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The present study also provides a new approach to recognize and validate an active constituent in traditional prescription through a selective depletion. D\n",

      "Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigenpresenting cells and have come to be appreciated as critical controllers of the immune response, especially T cell responses. Apart from presenting antigens to T cells, DCs carry out many other functions in regulating immunity. DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is a novel receptor that plays an important role in DC migration and adhesion, the inflammatory response, T cell activation, initiating the immune response, and immune escape of pathogens and tumors. DC-SIGN mediates DC binding to ICAM-3 on the T cell surface and ICAM-2 on the endothelial cell (EC) surface, and takes part in the initial interaction between DC and T cells or vascular ECs. The procedure of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a method in which single-stranded oligonucleotides are selected from a wide variety of sequences, based on their interaction with a target molecule. In this study, we selected DNA aptamers against DC-SIGN protein by SE-LEX, and measured their binding affinity for DC-SIGN. Finally, an appropriate aptamer with high affinity for DC-SIGN was obtained, and it blocked DC adhesion to ECs as effectively as anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "The reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins function as virus-encoded cellular fusogens, mediating efficient cell-cell rather than virus-cell membrane fusion. With ectodomains of only ,20-40 residues, it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity, and in their natural biological context of promoting cell-cell fusion, rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins, however, are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cell-cell fusion, but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens, designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. The capacity of surrogate, non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cell-cell fusion activity of the FAST proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine. These results also provide a basis for reconciling the rudimentary structure of the FAST proteins with their capacity to fuse cellular membranes.\n",

      "In this article, we describe the design, synthesis and activity evaluation of glycomimetic DC-SIGN antagonists, that use a mannose residue to anchor to the protein carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The molecules were designed from the structure of the known pseudo-mannobioside antagonist 1, by including additional hydrophobic groups, which were expected to engage lipophilic areas of DC-SIGN CRD. The results demonstrate that the synthesized compounds potently inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion to mannan coated plates. Additionally, in silico docking studies were performed to rationalize the results and to suggest further optimization.\n",

      "Regulation of the Epithelial Adhesion Molecule CEACAM1 Is Important for Palate Formation\n",
      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Cleft palate results from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors and occurs when the bilateral palatal shelves fail to fuse. The objective of this study was to search for new genes involved in mouse palate formation. Gene expression of murine embryonic palatal tissue was analyzed at various developmental stages before, during, and after palate fusion using GeneChipH microarrays. Ceacam1 was one of the highly up-regulated genes during palate formation, and this was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CEACAM1 was present in prefusion palatal epithelium and was degraded during fusion. To investigate the developmental role of CEACAM1, function-blocking antibody was added to embryonic mouse palate in organ culture. Palatal fusion was inhibited by this function-blocking antibody. To investigate the subsequent developmental role of CEACAM1, we characterized Ceacam1-deficient (Ceacam1 2/ 2 ) mice. Epithelial cells persisted abnormally at the midline of the embryonic palate even on day E16.0, and palatal fusion was delayed in Ceacam1 2/2 mice. TGFb3 expression, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in palatal epithelium were not affected in the palate of Ceacam1 2/2 mice. However, CEACAM1 expression was retained in the remaining MEE of TGFb-deficient mice. These results suggest that CEACAM1 has roles in the initiation of palatal fusion via epithelial cell adhesion.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sometimes causes acute and severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. RSV strongly upregulates proinflammatory cytokines and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Clarithromycin (CAM), which is an antimicrobial agent and is also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). CAM also suppressed RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and adhesion of fluorescein-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was thought to be mediated by the host cell's PAF receptor. CAM, which exhibits antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found in this study to suppress the RSV-induced adhesion of respiratory disease-causing bacteria, S. pneumoniae, to host cells. Thus, CAM might suppress immunological disorders and prevent secondary bacterial infections during RSV infection.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family (CEACAMs) are widely expressed, and, depending on the tissue, capable of regulating diverse functions including tumor promotion, tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and neutrophil activation. Four members of this family, CEACAM1, CEACAM8, CEACAM6, and CEACAM3 (recognized by CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, and CD66d mAbs, respectively), are expressed on human neutrophils. CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, and CD66d antibodies each increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. This increase in neutrophil adhesion caused by CD66 antibodies is blocked by CD18 mAbs and is associated with upregulation of CD11/CD18 on the neutrophil surface. To examine potential interactions of CEACAMs in neutrophil signaling, the effects on neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells of a set of CD66 mAbs was tested following desensitization to stimulation by various combinations of these mAbs. Addition of a CD66 mAb in the absence of calcium results in desensitization of neutrophils to stimulation by that CD66 mAb. The current data show that desensitization of neutrophils to any two CEACAMs results in selective desensitization to those two CEACAMs, while the cells remain responsive to the other two neutrophil CEACAMs. In addition, cells desensitized to CEACAM-3, -6, and -8 were still responsive to stimulation of CEACAM1 by CD66a mAbs. In contrast, desensitization of cells to CEACAM1 and any two of the other CEACAMs left the cells unresponsive to all CD66 mAbs. Cells desensitized to any combination of CEACAMs remained responsive to the unrelated control protein CD63. Thus, while there is significant independence of the four neutrophil CEACAMs in signaling, CEACAM1 appears to play a unique role among the neutrophil CEACAMs. A model in which CEACAMs dimerize to form signaling complexes could accommodate the observations. Similar interactions may occur in other cells expressing CEACAMs.\n",

The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the probiotic potential and safety of LAB strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a wild boar from the Greater Khingan Mountains, China. Amongst all of the isolated LAB strains, five isolates identified as Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, and Enterococcus faecium, were remarkably resistant to acid and bile salt. The probiotic characteristics (including adhesion capability, antimicrobial activities, autoaggregation, and coaggregation abilities), and safety properties (including hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance, absence/presence of virulence factors, and in vivo safety) were evaluated. The results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential, remarkable aggregation capacity, and antibacterial activities. Upon assessment of the safety, these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes. In vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice. This study revealed that these LAB isolates, especially L. salivarius M2-71, possess desirable probiotic properties and have great potentials for the development of feed additives for animals to promote health.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the accumulation of active BCR-ABL protein. Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however, many patients are resistant to this drug. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in imatinib-resistant CML cells under different drug treatments. GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO+AMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "ForceÀdistance measurements have been used to examine differences in the interaction of the dendritic cell glycan-binding receptor DC-SIGN and the closely related endothelial cell receptor DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN) with membranes bearing glycan ligands. The results demonstrate that upon binding to membraneanchored ligand, DC-SIGNR undergoes a conformational change similar to that previously observed for DC-SIGN. The results also validate a model for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR derived from crystallographic studies. Force measurements were performed with DC-SIGNR variants that differ in the length of the neck that result from genetic polymorphisms, which encode different numbers of the 23-amino acid repeat sequences that constitute the neck. The findings are consistent with an elongated, relatively rigid structure of the neck repeat observed in crystals. In addition, differences in the lengths of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains with equivalent numbers of neck repeats support a model in which the different dispositions of the carbohydrate-recognition domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR result from variations in the sequences of the necks.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "There is an increasing demand for non-antibiotics solutions to control infectious disease in intensive pig production. Here, one such alternative, namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production. A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in >85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4+ challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity. Conclusively, our data support the idea that natural IgG directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of PWD and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Vascular endothelial activation, marked by de novo expression of E-selectin, is an early and essential event in the process of leukocyte extravasation and inflammation. Evidence suggests that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates inflammation in animal models of renal disease, implying that HGF might inhibit specific components of the inflammatory response. This study examined the effect of HGF on endothelial E-selectin expression in acute inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. In vitro, HGF suppressed TNF-a-induced cell surface expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited E-selectin mediated monocytic adhesion to endothelial monolayers. HGF activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt that in turn inhibited its downstream transducer glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3. Blockade of the PI3K-Akt pathway with specific inhibitors abrogated HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppression of E-selectin. In addition, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity by lithium suppressed TNF-a-induced E-selectin expression and monocytic adhesion, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Moreover, ectopic expression of an uninhibitable mutant GSK3b, in which the regulatory serine-9 is replaced by alanine, abolished HGF's suppressive effect on endothelial E-selectin. In vivo, administration of exogenous HGF reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin induced by bolus injection of TNF-a. This was associated with less sequestration of circulating fluorescence-labeled macrophages in the kidney. These findings suggest that HGF ameliorates acute renal inflammation in part by downregulating E-selectin mediated macrophage adhesion to the inflamed endothelium.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Enteric pathogens cause considerable public health concerns worldwide including tropical regions. Here, we review the roles of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of various enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria and protozoa, which infect the epithelial lining of the human and animal intestine. At host cell entry, enteric viruses, including norovirus, recognize mainly histo-blood group antigens. At the initial step of bacterial infections, carbohydrates also function as receptors for attachment. Here, we describe the function of carbohydrates in infection by Salmonella enterica and several bacterial species that produce a variety of fimbrial adhesions. During invasion by enteropathogenic protozoa, apicomplexan parasites utilize sialic acids or sulfated glycans. Carbohydrates serve as receptors for infection by these microbes; however, their usage of carbohydrates varies depending on the microbe. On the surface of the mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, various carbohydrate moieties are present and play a crucial role in infection, representing the site of infection or route of access for most microbes. During the infection and/or invasion process of the microbes, carbohydrates function as receptors for various microbes, but they can also function as a barrier to infection. One approach to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents is to modify the drug structure. Another approach is to modify the mode of inhibition of infection depending on the individual pathogen by using and mimicking the interactions with carbohydrates. In addition, similarities in mode of infection may also be utilized. Our findings will be useful in the development of new drugs for the treatment of enteric pathogens.\n",

      "F4 + enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains cause diarrheal disease in neonatal and post-weaned piglets. Several different host receptors for F4 fimbriae have been described, with porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) reported most recently. The FaeG subunit is essential for the binding of the three F4 variants to host cells. Here we show in both yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays that APN binds directly to FaeG, the major subunit of F4 fimbriae, from three serotypes of F4 + ETEC. Modulating APN gene expression in IPEC-J2 cells affected ETEC adherence. Antibodies raised against APN or F4 fimbriae both reduced ETEC adherence. Thus, APN mediates the attachment of F4 + E. coli to intestinal epithelial cells. © 2016 Xia et al.

Isoforms of murine CEACAM1 serve as receptors for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus. Here we report the crystal structure of soluble murine sCEACAM1a [1,4], which is composed of two Ig-like domains and has MHV neutralizing activity. Its N-terminal domain has a uniquely folded CC¢ loop that encompasses key virusbinding residues. This is the ®rst atomic structure of any member of the CEA family, and provides a prototypic architecture for functional exploration of CEA family members. We discuss the structural basis of virus receptor activities of murine CEACAM1 proteins, binding of Neisseria to human CEACAM1, and other homophilic and heterophilic interactions of CEA family members.\n",

      "Objective: There have been few reports on the role of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), but not interleukin-21 (IL-21) and interleukin-23 (IL-23) in tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and neuroborreliosis (NB). We postulate that these two interleukins may participate in the early phase of TBE and NB. The aim of the study was to measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of ICAM-1, IL-21 and IL-23 in patients with TBE and NB before treatment and to assess their usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory process in TBE and NB. Methods: Forty-three patients hospitalized in The were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: TBE, NB and CG. Pre-treatment blood and CSF samples were obtained from all patients. ELISA kits (DRG Instruments, Germany) were used to measure the concentration of IL-21, IL-23 and sICAM-1. Results: Significant differences between TBE/CG and NB/CG concentration of sICAM-1 were found only in the CSF. CSF IL-21 levels in NB were lower than in TBE. In TBE, a strong negative correlation between CSF concentration of IL-21 and IL-23 and monocyte count in CSF was observed. Negative correlation between IL-21 in CSF and neutrophil count was also noted. Serum IL-23 correlated positively with leukocytes and platelet count in serum. In NB, a strong positive correlation between serum IL-21 and platelet count and negative correlation between IL-21 in serum and CSF with pleocytosis was observed. Conclusions: Increased sICAM-1 concentration in TBE and NB may be a proof of brain-blood barrier disturbances in the early phase of these diseases. IL-21 and IL-23 do not appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the early stages of TBE and NB.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Viruses are one of the major causes of various acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape. author/funder.

      "Carbohydrate has been removed from a number of glycoproteins without major effect on the structure or enzyme activity of the protein. Thus carbohydrate has been suggested to underly a non-primary function for proteins, such as in relatively non-specific interactions with other carbohydrates or macromolecules, stabilization of protein conformation, or protection from proteolysis. This non-specific concept is consistent with both the general similarity in carbohydrate structure on very diverse glycoproteins and the frequent structural microheterogeneity of carbohydrate chains at given sites. The concept is supported in a general sense by the viability of cells whose glycosylation processes have been globally disrupted by mutation or pharmacological inhibitors.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile childhood vasculitis, associated with the development of coronary artery abnormalities in 25-30% of untreated patients. The aetiopathogenesis is not well known but it is accepted that an undefined infectious trigger in genetically predisposed individuals results in the disease. KD is characterized by an endothelial cell injury, which could be due to abnormal cytokine production and to generation of cytotoxic antibodies against the endothelial cells. Intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG is an effective treatment in preventing the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities in KD. Several mechanisms may explain the anti-inflammatory effects of IVIG in this disease. They include modification of the cytokine balance, and alteration on both the differentiation and the function of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "CD9 belongs to the tetraspanin superfamily. Depending on the cell type and associated molecules, CD9 has a wide variety of biological activities such as cell adhesion, motility, metastasis, growth, signal transduction, differentiation, and sperm-egg fusion. This review focuses on CD9 expression by hematopoietic cells and its role in modulating cellular processes involved in the regulation of inflammation. CD9 is functionally very important in many diseases and is involved either in the regulation or in the mediation of the disease. The role of CD9 in various diseases, such as viral and bacterial infections, cancer and chronic lung allograft dysfunction, is discussed. This review focuses also on its interest as a biomarker in diseases. Indeed CD9 is primarily known as a specific exosome marker however, its expression is now recognized as an anti-inflammatory marker of monocytes and macrophages. It was also described as a marker of murine IL-10-competent Breg cells and IL-10-secreting CD9 + B cells were associated with better allograft outcome in lung transplant patients, and identified as a new predictive biomarker of long-term survival. In the field of cancer, CD9 was both identified as a favorable prognostic marker or as a predictor of metastatic potential depending on cancer types. Finally, this review discusses strategies to target CD9 as a therapeutic tool. Because CD9 can have opposite effects depending on the situation, the environment and the pathology, modulating CD9 expression or blocking its effects seem to be a new promising therapeutic strategy.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "The fiber knob of adenovirus (Ad) causes the first step in the interaction of adenovirus with cell membrane receptors. To obtain information on the receptor binding site(s) several synthetic peptides derived from Ad2 and Ad3 fiber head sequences and their antisera were tested for interference with virus attachment to HeLa and FL cells and cell adhesion to viruses. The anti-peptide sera were also evaluated in ELISA and virus neutralisation test. Ad2 (of subgroup C) and Ad3 (of subgroup B) attachment was not significantly inhibited by peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 535 554, 555-573, 562-582 of Ad2 fiber or 210-225, 267-283, 291-306 and 300-319 of Ad3 fiber. However, microplate pre-adsorbed Ad3 fiber residues 210 225 and 267 283 could bind FL and HeLa cells, and 1 mg/ml of Ad3 fiber residues 267-283 inhibited the cell adhesion to Ad3 virus to approximately 90%. This peptide may participate in the receptor binding site of Ad3 fiber. ELISA reactive anti-peptide antibodies against the homologous peptide and virus did not significantly reduce the cell adhesion to the immobilised virus or the virus attachment to cells, but in the neutralisation assay antibodies raised to Ad2 fiber residues 555-573 and 562-582 and Ad3 fiber residues 210-225 caused neutralisation of the homologous virus at serum dilutions of 1:500 and 1:32, respectively. The corresponding peptides and one further peptide of Ad2 fiber and two of Ad3 fiber seem to contain neutralisation epitopes.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Mycoplasma suis (M. suis) is an extracellular bacterial organism that attaches to and causes deformity and damage to porcine red blood cells. M. suis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like protein 1 (MSG1), a membraneassociated adhesion protein, plays a major role in M. suis attachment and infection of porcine erythrocytes. In order to identify the epitopes in MSG1 protein of M. suis, recombinant MSG1 (rMSG1) expressed in Escherichia coli Top10 was purified with affinity chromatography and used to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare and screen monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Western blot results showed that 1C10, 2F10, 4G10, and 10E9 can specifically react with recombinant MSG1 and M. suis. Moreover, 23 truncated fragments of MSG1 were amplified and cloned into pET-32a vector and induced by IPTG. Different recombinant truncated proteins were used to identify B cell epitopes in the rMSG1 protein. Epitope mapping revealed that MAb 1C10 recognizes the linear epitope D 291 THGSVF 297 ; MAb 2F10 recognizes the linear epitope L 251 CLKI 255 ; and MAbs 4G10 and 10E9 recognize the linear epitope I 268 KDGENE 274 . The alignment of MSG1 epitope sequences with that of different M. suis strains accessed on NCBI showed that one epitope is highly conserved in M. suis strains. This research is the first to examine the epitopes in MSG1 of M. suis and demonstrate the variations of epitopes.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "TNF is highly expressed in synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, where it induces proinflammatory cytokine secretion. However, in other cases, TNF will cause cell death. Considering the abnormal proliferation and activation of rheumatoid arthritis synovioblasts, the proper rate of synovioblast apoptosis could possibly relieve arthritis. However, the mechanism mediating TNF-induced synovioblast survival versus cell death in RA is not fully understood. Our objective was to study the role of CD147 in TNF downstream pathway preference in RA synovioblasts. We found that overexpressing TNF in synovial tissue did not increase the apoptotic level and, in vitro, TNFinduced mild synovioblast apoptosis and promoted IL-6 secretion. CD147, which was highly expressed in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), increased the resistance of synovioblasts to apoptosis under TNF stimulation. Downregulating CD147 both increased the apoptotic rate and inhibited IκB kinase (IKK)/IκB/NF-κB pathway-dependent proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Further, we determined that it was the extracellular portion of CD147 and not the intracellular portion that was responsible for synovioblast apoptosis resistance. CD147 monoclonal antibody inhibited TNF-induced proinflammatory cytokine production but had no effect on apoptotic rates. Thus, our study indicates that CD147 is resistant to TNFinduced apoptosis by promoting IKK/IκB/NF-κB pathway, and the extracellular portion of CD147 is the functional region.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "CD147 is an activation induced glycoprotein that promotes the secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and is upregulated during the differentiation of macrophages. Interestingly, some of the molecular functions of CD147 rely on its glycosylation status: the highly glycosylated forms of CD147 induce MMPs whereas the lowly glycosylated forms inhibit MMP activation. Statins are hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that block the synthesis of mevalonate, thereby inhibiting all mevalonatedependent pathways, including isoprenylation, N-glycosylation and cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we investigated the role of statins in the inhibition of macrophage differentiation and the associated process of MMP secretion through modulation of CD147. We observed that differentiation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to a macrophage phenotype led to upregulation of CD147 and CD14 and that this effect was inhibited by statins. At the molecular level, statins altered CD147 expression, structure and function by inhibiting isoprenylation and N-glycosylation. In addition, statins induced a shift of CD147 from its highly glycosylated form to its lowly glycosylated form. This shift in N-glycosylation status was accompanied by a decrease in the production and functional activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, these findings describe a novel molecular mechanism of immune regulation by statins, making them interesting candidates for autoimmune disease therapy.

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Cellular receptor-mediated signaling pathways play critical roles during the initial immune response to Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. However, the involvement of type-I transmembrane glycoprotein CD147/EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) in the antiviral response to HCMV infection is still unknown. Here, we demonstrated the specific knockdown of CD147 significantly decreased HCMV-induced activation of NF-κB and Interferon-beta (IFN-β), which contribute to the cellular antiviral responses. Next, we confirmed that HCMV-encoded miR-US25-1-5p could target the 3 UTR (Untranslated Region) of CD147 mRNA, and thus facilitate HCMV lytic propagation at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). The expression and secretion of Cyclophilin A (sCyPA), as a ligand for CD147 and a proinflammatory cytokine, were up-regulated in response to HCMV stimuli. Finally, we confirmed that CD147 mediated HCMV-triggered antiviral signaling via the sCyPA-CD147-ERK (extracellular regulated protein kinases)/NF-κB axis signaling pathway. These findings reveal an important HCMV mechanism for evading antiviral innate immunity through its encoded microRNA by targeting transmembrane glycoprotein CD147, and a potential cause of HCMV inflammatory disorders due to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine CyPA.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Neisseria meningitidis is a cause of meningitis epidemics worldwide and of rapidly progressing fatal septic shock. A crucial step in the pathogenesis of invasive meningococcal infections is the adhesion of bloodborne meningococci to both peripheral and brain endothelia, leading to major vascular dysfunction. Initial adhesion of pathogenic strains to endothelial cells relies on meningococcal type IV pili, but the endothelial receptor for bacterial adhesion remains unknown. Here, we report that the immunoglobulin superfamily member CD147 (also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) or Basigin) is a critical host receptor for the meningococcal pilus components PilE and PilV. Interfering with this interaction potently inhibited the primary attachment of meningococci to human endothelial cells in vitro and prevented colonization of vessels in human brain tissue explants ex vivo and in humanized mice in vivo. These findings establish the molecular events by which meningococci target human endothelia, and they open new perspectives for treatment and prevention of meningococcus-induced vascular dysfunctions. npg\n",

      "HYPOTHESIS AND THEORY ARTICLE Dangerous liaisons: molecular basis for a syndemic relationship between Kaposi's sarcoma and P. falciparum malaria\n",
      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "The most severe manifestations of malaria (caused by Plasmodium falciparum) occur as a direct result of parasitemia following invasion of erythrocytes by post-liver blood-stage merozoites, and during subsequent cyto-adherence of infected erythrocytes to the vascular endothelium. However, the disproportionate epidemiologic clustering of severe malaria with aggressive forms of endemic diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a neoplasm that is etiologically linked to infection with KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), underscores the significance of previously unexplored co-pathogenetic interactions that have the potential to modify the overall disease burden in co-infected individuals. Based on recent studies of the mechanisms that P. falciparum and KSHV have evolved to interact with their mutual human host, several new perspectives are emerging that highlight a surprising convergence of biological themes potentially underlying their associated co-morbidities. Against this background, ongoing studies are rapidly constructing a fascinating new paradigm in which the major host receptors that control parasite invasion (Basigin/CD147) and cyto-adherence (CD36) are, surprisingly, also important targets for exploitation by KSHV. In this article, we consider the major pathobiological implications of the co-option of Basigin/CD147 and CD36 signaling pathways by both P. falciparum and KSHV, not only as essential host factors for parasite persistence but also as important mediators of the pro-angiogenic phenotype within the virus-infected endothelial microenvironment. Consequently, the triangulation of interactions between P. falciparum, KSHV, and their mutual human host articulates a syndemic relationship that points to a conceptual framework for prevalence of aggressive forms of KS in malaria-endemic areas, with implications for the possibility of dual-use therapies against these debilitating infections in resource-limited parts of the world.\n",

      "abstract:\n",
      "Background: Acquisition of resistance to \"anoikis\" facilitates the survival of cells under independent matrix-deficient conditions, such as cells in tumor progression and the production of suspension culture cells for biomedical engineering. There is evidence suggesting that CD147, an adhesion molecule associated with survival of cells in tumor metastasis and cell-cell contacts, plays an important role in resistance to anoikis. However, information regarding the functions of CD147 in mediating cell-cell contacts and anoikis-resistance remains limited and even self-contradictory.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Cyclophilin A (CypA) is the main member of the immunophilin superfamily that has peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. CypA participates in protein folding, cell signaling, inflammation and tumorigenesis. Further, CypA plays critical roles in the replication of several viruses. Upon influenza virus infection, CypA inhibits viral replication by interacting with the M1 protein. In addition, CypA is incorporated into the influenza virus virions. Finally, Cyclosporin A (CsA), the main inhibitor of CypA, inhibits influenza virus replication through CypA-dependent and -independent pathways. This review briefly summarizes recent advances in understanding the roles of CypA during influenza virus infection.\n",

      "Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a ubiquitously distributed protein belonging to the immunophilin family. CyPA has peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, which regulates protein folding and trafficking. Although CyPA was initially believed to function primarily as an intracellular protein, recent studies have revealed that it can be secreted by cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. Current research in animal models and humans has provided compelling evidences supporting the critical function of CyPA in several human diseases. This review discusses recently available data about CyPA in cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, neurodegeneration, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, asthma, periodontitis and aging. It is believed that further elucidations of the role of CyPA will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and will help develop novel pharmacological therapies.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Background: Viruses are obligate parasites that depend on the cellular machinery of the host to regenerate and manufacture their proteins. Most antiviral drugs on the market today target viral proteins. However, the more recent strategies involve targeting the host cell proteins or pathways that mediate viral replication. This new approach would be effective for most viruses while minimizing drug resistance and toxicity. Methods: Cytomegalovirus replication, latency, and immune response are mediated by the intermediate early protein 2, the main protein that determines the effectiveness of drugs in cytomegalovirus inhibition. This review explains how intermediate early protein 2 can modify the action of cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive, and antiviral drug. It also links all the pathways mediated by cyclosporin A, cytomegalovirus replication, and its encoded proteins. Results: Intermediate early protein 2 can influence the cellular cyclophilin A pathway, affecting cyclosporin A as a mediator of viral replication or anti-cytomegalovirus drug. Conclusion: Cyclosporin A has a dual function in cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. It has the immunosuppressive effect that establishes virus replication through the inhibition of T-cell function. It also has an anti-cytomegalovirus effect mediated by intermediate early protein 2. Both of these functions involve cyclophilin A pathway.\n",

A number of reports have demonstrated that CyPA plays a critical role in the successful replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), etc. However, recent studies demonstrated that CyPA also possesses a repressive effect on the replication of some viruses like Influenza A virus and rotavirus. Moreover, CyPA could also regulate host IFN-I response to viral infections. Together, these evidences showed diverse roles of CyPA in viral infection.\n",

      "\n",
      "abstract:\n",
      "Coronaviruses infect a variety of mammalian and avian species and cause serious diseases in humans, cats, mice, and birds in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), mouse hepatitis, and avian infectious bronchitis, respectively. No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for SARScoronavirus or FIP virus, both of which cause lethal diseases. It has been reported that a cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), could inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. The inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol into the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been described for many years to include chaperone and foldase activities. Also, many viruses require cyclophilins for replication; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the suppression of viral replication differ for different viruses. This review describes the suppressive effects of CsA on coronavirus replication.\n",
